Neighbor
clustering
provides
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
the
molecular
responses
of
streptococci
during
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
.

We
used
this
approach
to
analyze
microarray
expression
data
from
group
A
streptococci
(
Streptococcus
pyogenes
)
during
adherence
to
human
pharyngeal
cells
,
the
first
overt
infection
step
[
7
]
.

This
analysis
identified
79
genes
(
4
%
of
the
genome
)
exhibiting
statistically
significant
fold
changes
in
expression
(
PF
value
<
0
.
05
)
during
adherence
from
1
,
769
open
reading
frames
represented
on
the
array
(
Table
1
)
.

We
refer
to
such
genes
as
"
differentially
expressed
.
"
We
present
the
entire
dataset
from
all
experiments
as
Table
S1
.

Genes
demonstrating
upregulation
(
n
=
45
)
and
downregulation
(
n
=
34
)
included
virulence
factors
,
prophage
-
encoded
transcripts
,
metabolic
genes
,
and
transcriptional
regulators
(
Table
2
)
.

The
initial
statistical
analysis
identified
four
differentially
expressed
virulence
genes
(
Tables
1
and
2
)
.

Although
few
studies
have
examined
gene
expression
patterns
during
adherence
,
SpeB
production
(
as
detected
by
Western
blot
analysis
)
decreases
during
co
-
culture
with
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
[
30
]
and
in
a
mouse
infection
model
[
31
]
.

We
also
identified
the
adherence
-
mediated
upregulation
of
four
transcriptional
regulators
(
Table
1
)
,
suggestive
of
an
adaptive
response
to
host
cell
contact
that
is
dynamic
and
complex
.

Our
initial
analysis
revealed
the
differential
expression
of
a
wide
range
of
functionally
diverse
genes
and
provided
insight
into
the
adaptive
response
of
streptococci
to
host
cell
contact
.

If
transcription
is
internally
disrupted
by
such
a
terminator
,
the
abundance
of
the
sagA
transcript
may
be
much
greater
than
the
polycistronic
message
;
such
disproportionate
transcript
levels
would
affect
log2
-
fold
change
values
and
impact
the
statistical
significance
of
individual
genes
within
these
types
of
clusters
.

Importantly
,
because
functional
gene
data
are
not
incorporated
into
its
algorithms
,
GenomeCrawler
is
not
biased
toward
identifying
"
expected
"
clusters
.

Based
on
the
Type
I
cluster
results
,
we
speculated
that
genes
contained
in
Type
II
clusters
might
be
related
by
function
or
regulation
.

We
note
,
however
,
that
despite
the
statistical
framework
with
which
groupings
are
assigned
,
experimental
evidence
is
necessary
to
confirm
functional
or
regulatory
relatedness
.

A
total
of
18
(
90
%
)
of
20
Type
II
clusters
(
Table
3
and
Figure
S3
)
may
not
have
been
identified
without
neighbor
clustering
:
eight
(
44
.
4
%
)
of
18
gained
additional
gene
members
;
the
remaining
ten
comprised
genes
that
demonstrated
significant
differential
expression
only
after
applying
GenomeCrawler
.

Together
with
the
identification
of
this
cluster
by
GenomeCrawler
,
these
results
prompted
us
to
study
this
cluster
and
the
contributions
of
the
gene
products
to
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
.

Experimental
confirmation
of
each
candidate
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
study
,
but
Northern
blot
and
RT
-
PCR
analyses
could
provide
such
information
.

Analysis
of
Previously
Published
Array
Data

We
applied
the
statistical
analysis
and
the
GenomeCrawler
algorithms
to
data
from
a
recently
published
streptococcal
microarray
study
that
is
relevant
for
comparison
to
our
own
data
(
same
streptococcal
strain
,
similar
array
platform
)
[
57
]
.

Neighbor
clustering
was
able
to
extend
the
results
by
identifying
more
differentially
expressed
genes
and
reconstructing
more
intact
biological
pathways
.

Finally
,
because
of
the
common
architecture
of
bacterial
chromosomes
,
the
neighbor
clustering
algorithms
may
be
applicable
to
microarray
datasets
from
other
prokaryotes
.

The
long
(
FimA
)
fimbriae
have
been
extensively
studied
.

Expression
of
the
fimA
gene
is
tightly
controlled
by
a
two
-
component
system
(
FimS
/
FimR
)
through
a
cascade
regulation
.

Coadhesion
and
biofilm
development
between
P
.
gingivalis
and
Streptococcus
gordonii
require
the
interaction
of
Mfa1
with
streptococcal
protein
SspB
(
Park
et
al
.
,
2005
)
.

Mfa1
expression
appears
to
fluctuate
under
various
growth
conditions
(
Masuda
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

In
a
nutrient
-
limited
medium
,
expression
of
FimA
and
Mfa1
are
inhibited
in
P
.
gingivalis
,
whereas
such
differences
are
not
found
in
gingipain
expression
.

Results

Role
of
FimR
in
mfa1
expression
The
fimA
gene
is
the
only
gene
known
to
be
tightly
controlled
by
the
FimS
/
FimR
system
.

Expression
of
fimA
and
mfa1
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
was
determined
using
real
-
time
PCR
analysis
.

Statistically
significant
differences
of
the
level
of
gene
expression
in
33277
and
the
fimR
-
mutant
were
calculated
by
a
Student
'
s
t
-
test
.

The
striking
finding
is
that
expression
of
the
mfa1
gene
was
also
repressed
threefold
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
although
not
to
the
degree
observed
with
the
fimA
expression
.

This
analysis
revealed
that
the
expression
of
the
fimA
and
mfa1
genes
was
consistent
at
the
mRNA
level
and
protein
level
(
Fig
.
1b
)
.

Similarly
,
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
RgpA
production
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
which
was
detected
by
anti
-
RgpA
serum
.

Cold
competitor
chase
experiments
with
a
100
-
fold
excess
of
unlabeled
DNA
probe
as
a
specific
competitor
were
also
used
to
demonstrate
the
specificity
of
rFimR
binding
.

Retarded
mfa1
promoter
-
rFimR
complex
was
detected
with
as
little
as
10
pmol
muL
-
1
rFimR
(
Fig
.
3
)
.

Expression
of
minor
fimbriae
(
mfa1
)
in
a
fimR
mutanthas
been
investigated
.

The
previous
study
suggested
that
regulation
of
fimA
expression
by
FimR
is
through
a
regulation
cascade
involving
interaction
of
FimR
and
the
promoter
region
of
the
first
gene
in
the
fimA
cluster
(
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

However
,
no
apparent
difference
was
found
in
DNA
-
binding
affinity
between
rFimRs
with
or
without
acetyl
phosphate
treatment
.

Phosphorylation
of
CovR
,
a
global
response
regulator
,
had
no
effect
on
its
DNA
-
binding
affinity
.

The
transcriptional
site
revealed
here
is
confirmed
by
RT
-
PCR
analysis
.

In
E
.
coli
,
two
promoters
direct
transcription
of
acs
encoding
,
an
acetate
-
scavenging
enzyme
required
for
fitness
during
periods
of
carbon
starvation
-
the
distal
acsP1
and
the
proximal
acsP2
(
Beatty
et
al
.
,
2003
)
.

The
hypothesis
is
currently
under
investigation
.

In
conclusion
,
P
.
gingivalis
fimbriae
play
a
predominant
role
in
the
attachment
of
the
organism
to
a
variety
of
oral
surfaces
(
Lamont
&
Jenkinson
,
2000
;
Amano
et
al
.
,
2004
)
,
although
other
surface
proteins
,
such
as
gingipains
,
may
also
be
involved
in
the
bacterial
colonization
(
Tokuda
et
al
.
,
1996
;
Chen
et
al
.
,
2001
)
.

Indeed
,
M
.
tuberculosis
has
retained
many
secrets
of
its
so
successful
pathogenic
lifecycle
.

One
of
them
is
the
"
Bacille
de
Calmette
et
Guerin
"
(
BCG
)
,
which
was
originally
derived
in
1921
from
a
virulent
Mycobacterium
bovis
strain
by
230
passages
on
potato
-
glycerol
-
ox
bile
medium
[
1
]
.

This
technique
has
previously
permitted
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
of
a
PA
-
824
drug
resistant
mutant
strain
of
H37Rv
to
be
detected
[
13
]
.

This
approach
was
combined
with
gene
"
knock
-
in
"
strategies
,
to
complement
selected
lesions
,
that
allowed
recombinant
H37Ra
strains
to
be
engineered
,
whose
virulence
and
immunogenicity
were
then
evaluated
in
in
vitro
,
ex
vivo
and
animal
models
.

By
this
combined
approach
we
identified
13
non
-
synonymous
SNPs
that
differed
between
the
H37Ra
and
H37Rv
strains
used
(
Table
S1
)
.

For
the
other
13
genes
we
found
no
indication
that
would
identify
them
as
potential
virulence
genes
,
as
none
of
them
belong
to
the
5
%
of
genes
that
were
previously
determined
by
transposon
site
hybridization
(
TraSH
)
as
being
essential
for
in
vivo
growth
of
M
.
tuberculosis
[
16
]
.

Clones
spanning
the
different
genomic
regions
of
non
-
synonymous
SNPs
were
selected
from
an
ordered
H37Rv
library
of
integrating
shuttle
cosmids
[
7
,
19
]
and
individually
electroporated
into
H37Ra
,
where
they
inserted
stably
into
the
attB
site
.

As
depicted
in
Figure
S2
,
hybridization
of
SpeI
-
digested
genomic
DNA
with
a
32P
labeled
phoP
probe
resulted
in
two
bands
of
different
sizes
,
one
corresponding
to
the
SpeI
fragment
harboring
the
H37Ra
phoP
gene
(
50
kb
)
,
and
the
other
to
the
larger
SpeI
fragment
created
by
integration
of
the
I36
cosmid
into
the
genome
of
H37Ra
at
the
attB
site
.

Changes
in
the
regulatory
potential
of
a
pathogen
are
often
accompanied
by
altered
virulence
.

Exactly
the
same
trend
was
observed
when
a
highly
sensitive
T
cell
hybridoma
assay
was
used
to
investigate
ESAT
-
6
secretion
.

Figure
4A
shows
that
infection
of
BM
-
DC
with
H37Ra
or
H37Ra
:
:
rpsL
induced
no
stimulation
of
the
hybridoma
as
judged
by
IL
-
2
production
,
while
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
or
H37Rv
triggered
high
amounts
of
IL
-
2
production
in
this
very
sensitive
and
specific
test
.

In
the
bacterial
world
the
PhoP
/
PhoR
like
two
-
component
systems
are
widely
distributed
and
fulfill
a
large
variety
of
functions
including
sensing
phosphate
and
magnesium
[
32
,
33
]
,
or
regulating
virulence
genes
[
34
]
.

Finally
,
microarray
-
based
trancriptome
analysis
using
the
wild
-
type
versus
a
phoP
ko
mutant
of
H37Rv
has
provided
an
overview
of
the
transcriptional
regulation
linked
to
PhoP
[
21
]
.

In
contrast
,
in
another
transcriptome
analysis
,
Mostowy
and
colleagues
[
11
]
found
several
genes
of
the
RD1
region
,
including
that
encoding
ESAT
-
6
,
among
the
genes
that
were
at
least
2
.
5
-
fold
lower
expressed
in
H37Ra
than
in
H37Rv
.

This
strain
was
previously
used
to
vaccinate
mice
and
guinea
pigs
and
conferred
good
protection
against
a
challenge
with
virulent
M

Comparative
analysis
of
the
Photorhabdus
luminescens
and
the
Yersinia
enterocolitica
genomes
:
uncovering
candidate
genes
involved
in
insect
pathogenicity

Background

However
,
bacteria
of
the
species
P
.
luminescens
are
exclusively
known
to
be
associated
with
nematodes
and
insects
.

To
uncover
candidate
genes
which
are
involved
in
insect
pathogenicity
,
a
total
of
424
(
P
.
luminescens
)
and
386
(
Y
.
enterocolitica
)
genes
and
proteins
predicted
to
belong
to
one
of
the
functional
categories
described
in
the
text
were
analysed
for
their
presence
or
absence
in
both
organisms
,
and
for
their
degree
of
similarity
.

The
role
of
PhoP
/
PhoQ
in
regulating
virulence
gene
expression
has
been
characterized
mainly
in
Salmonella
species
,
but
has
also
been
shown
,
in
addition
to
three
other
TCSs
,
to
be
important
for
virulence
of
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
[
29
,
30
]
.

The
only
TCS
of
P
.
luminescens
absent
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
is
TctE
/
TctD
(
Fig
.

,
marked
in

)
,
which
,
however
,
is
found
in
the
genomes
of
Y
.
intermedia
and
Y
.
frederiksenii
.

In
comparison
to
P
.
luminescens
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
uses
an
expanded
set
of
TCSs
,
possibly
to
adapt
to
its
various
hosts
(
Fig
.
1
)
.

The
DeltaluxS
mutant
also
showed
decreased
expression
of
virulence
factors
such
as
the
cytotoxic
protein
CcdB
,
the
hemolysin
secretion
protein
HlyD
(
Plu0635
)
,
and
the
toxin
ABC
transporter
subunits
RtxD
/
RtxB
.

Therefore
,
the
potential
PAS

/
LuxR
-
like
receptors
of
P
.
luminescens
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
and
S
.
glossinidius
might
sense
JH
or
other
eukaryotic
hormones
of
the
insect
to
adapt
their
gene
expression
to
the
insect
host
.

The
difference
in
the
number
of
the
uncommon
LuxR
-
like
receptors
(
35
in
P
.
luminescens
,
nine
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
)
gives
rise
to
speculations
that
the
insect
host
spectrum
is
constricted
for
Y
.
enterocolitica
compared
with
P
.
luminescens
.

This
hypothesis
is
underlined
by
the
fact
that
not
more
than
five
PAS
_
4
/
LuxR
-
like
receptors
are
present
in
S
.
glossinidius
for
which
only
one
insect
host
has
been
reported
.

Therefore
,
UspA
might
have
a
global
importance
in
P
.
luminescens
notifying
stress
and
transmitting
signals
for
HexA
[

.

A

homologue
is

P

that
have
been
suggested
to

encoding

(

,
a

steroid
monooxygenase
(
Plu4232
)
,
and
a

(

,

of
which
have
no
counterparts
in

Secretion
and
exoenzymes

The
typical
effector
proteins
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
are
also
present
in
P
.
luminescens
.

Due
to
its
absence
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
Ymt
is
another
example
for
the
high
diversity
of
genetic
determinants
that
are
used
by
closely
related
bacterial
pathogens
to
interact
with
their
insect
hosts
.

We
speculate
that
these
Y
.
enterocolitica
proteases
could
be
involved
in
the
infection
process
in
mammals
,
whereas
the
P
.
luminescens
proteases
are
rather
used
for
nutrient
bioconversion
than
for
the
infection
process
.

While
many
specific
virulence
factors
,
which
enable
the
microbes
to
overcome
the
various
physical
and
biochemical
barriers
of
the
infected
hosts
,
have
been
investigated
in
detail
,
little
attention
has
been
given
to
the
metabolic
requirements
and
substrate
availability
of
bacteria
in
vivo
.

Beside
S
.
typhimurium
,
all
these
genetic
determinants
were
found
only
in
few
other
bacteria
,
namely
the
human
pathogens
Listeria
monocytogenes
,
and
Clostridium
perfringens
[
101
]
.

Moreover
,
several
genes
induced
at
lower
temperature
such
as
inv
,
yst
or
yplA
affect
the
virulence
properties
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
in
mice
[
87
]
.

However
,
low
temperature
-
dependent
expression
of
the
genes
in
Table
1
suggests
that
they
also
play
a
role
during
the
insect
stage
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
or
that
they
have
evolved
from
bacteria
-
insect
interaction
and
then
adapted
to
pathogenicity
towards
mammals
.

It
was
assumed
that
there
are
parallels
in
the
regulation
of
pathogenicity
in
mammals
and
insect
pathogens
[
41
,
123
]
.

Moreover
,
P
.
luminescens
is
pathogenic
to
a
variety
of
insect
larvae
,
and
a
dose
of
<
5
colony
-
forming
units
directly
injected
into
the
blood
system
is
sufficient
to
kill
within
48
-
72
h
[
124
]
.

One
such
mechanism
is
based
upon
modification
of
phospholipids
in
the
cytoplasmic
membrane
by
introducing
a
positively
charged
lysyl
group
into
anionic
phosphatidylglycerol
by
the
MprF
protein
,
thereby
neutralizing
the
net
charge
of
the
membrane
surface
[
11
,
12
]
.

Mechanisms
involved
in
the
regulation
of
these
resistance
factors
are
not
yet
well
understood
in
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
.

Accordingly
,
the
WT
and
complemented
mutant
strains
showed
no
significant
decrease
in
CFU
following
LL
-
37
exposure
,
whereas
the
number
of
graRS
mutant
bacteria
recovered
was
only
25
%
of
the
original
inoculum
(
Fig

)
.

Introduction

The
strains
of
emm1
genotype
,
among
more
than
100
emm
genes
encoding
the
serotype
-
determinant
M
protein
,
are
the
predominant
cause
of
severe
GAS
infections
in
Japan
[
7
]
.

These
findings
led
us
to
postulate
that
invasive
GAS
infections
hampered
host
innate
immune
defense
,
especially
on
PMN
,
providing
the
front
-
line
defense
against
GAS
infection
by
quick
recruitment
to
infection
site
and
clearance
of
bacteria
following
phagocytosis
[
11
]
,
[
12
]
.

However
,
restricted
availability
of
clinical
isolates
with
the
same
serotypes
fail
to
elucidate
direct
relationship
between
definitive
genetic
changes
in
clinically
isolated
severe
invasive
GAS
and
the
lack
of
PMN
at
the
site
of
bacterial
growth
.

As
non
-
opsonized
GAS
was
resistant
to
the
phagocytosis
by
PMN
[
14
]
,
we
opsonized
GAS
with
human
plasma
in
advance
to
the
assay
.

However
,
as
shown
in
Figure
1B
,
in
vitro
killing
assay
revealed
that
PMN
killed
non
-
invasive
GAS
,
resulting
in
15
-
42
%
of
initial
number
of
bacteria
,
but
not
invasive
GAS
(
p
=
0
.
019
)
.

In
an
acute
bacterial
infection
,
PMN
were
quickly
recruited
at
the
site
of
infectious
foci
according
to
the
gradient
of
chemoattractants
.

As
shown
in
Figure
2A
and
2B
,
a
substantial
number
of
PMN
,
consisted
largely
of
viable
cells
,
was
detected
in
the
lower
wells
consisted
of
IL
-
8
and
non
-
invasive
GAS
,
as
a
control
.

To
confirm
that
SLO
activity
is
increased
in
invasive
GAS
strain
,
we
measured
SLO
hemolytic
activity
of
GAS
strains
used
in
this
study
.

However
,
as
shown
in
Figure
5B
,
the
csrS
genes
of
all
clinically
isolated
severe
invasive
GAS
had
a
deletion
,
a
point
mutation
,
or
an
insertion
,
thereby
,
resulting
in
the
creation
of
translational
stop
codons
(
NIH147
,
NIH226
,
NIH230
,
and
NIH269
)
or
in
a
mutation
in
the
presumed
kinase
domain
(
NIH200
)
.

Extracellular
deoxyribonuclease
(
DNase
)
is
a
virulence
factor
that
protects
emm1
type
GAS
against
neutrophil
killing
by
degrading
the
DNA
framework
of
neutrophil
extracelluar
traps
(
NETs
)
[
25
]
,
[
26
]
.

PMN
-
binding
GAS
may
make
a
small
interface
containing
a
high
concentration
of
SLO
between
bacteria
and
PMN
,
which
resembles
to
killing
mechanism
of
killer
cells
to
target
cells
[
30
]
.

Consistently
,
the
high
mortality
and
histopathological
findings
which
lacks
PMN
infiltration
in
mice
tissues
infected
with
csrS
-
mutated
GAS
(
Figure
7
)
are
similar
to
those
seen
in
clinical
invasive
GAS
infections
[
32
]
.

Thus
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
ability
of
incompetence
for
PMN
functions
by
individual
GAS
strain
may
determine
the
induction
and
clinical
outcome
of
invasive
diseases
.

To
date
,
extracellular
DNA
has
been
shown
to
function
as
a
structural
support
to
maintain
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
biofilm
architecture
.

Thus
,
the
presence
of
extracellular
DNA
in
the
biofilm
matrix
contributes
to
cation
gradients
,
genomic
DNA
release
and
inducible
antibiotic
resistance
.

Although
the
basis
of
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
is
not
fully
understood
,
it
is
likely
that
multiple
mechanisms
operate
simultaneously
in
biofilms
to
contribute
to
antibiotic
resistance
.

Other
resistance
mechanisms
include
the
presence
of
subpopulations
of
multidrug
tolerant
persister
cells
[
27
]
-
[
29
]
,
drug
indifference
of
slow

growing
,
nutrient
-
limited
cells
[
30
]
,
and
unique
resistance
mechanisms
specifically
associated
with
biofilms
[
31
]
,
[
32
]
.

The
extracellular
matrix
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
includes
extracellular
DNA
[
50
]
,
[
51
]
,
multiple
bacterial
exopolysaccharides
and
host
proteins
[
4
]
,
[
52
]
.

Genomic
DNA
has
been
shown
to
localize
to
the
biofilm
surface
,
surrounding
the
mushroom
-

microcolonies
[

.

was
used
to
visualize
DNA
as
a
loose
lattice
in
biofilms
formed
on
polystyrene
pegs
after
24
h
(
Fig
5A
)
.

These
localization
patterns
of
extracellular
DNA
are
suggestive
of
DNA
gradients
within
biofilms
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
indicate
that
P
.
aeruginosa
can
sense
the
presence
of
Mg2
+
,
Ca2
+
or
Mn2
+
and
that
chelation
of
these
same
cations
by
DNA
results
in
induction
of
the

.

Biofilms
were

of

%

)
,
and
challenged

.

The
CAP
resistance
phenotype
of
biofilms
grown
in
limiting

(

microM
)
was
similar
to
biofilms
grown
in
DNA
,
confirming
that
DNA
imposes
a
magnesium
limitation
stress
(
Table
2
)
.

We
have
identified
a
novel
mechanism
of
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
in
which
the
presence
of
DNA
in
the
extracellular
matrix
of
biofilms
creates
a
localized
cation
-
limited
environment
that
is
detected
by
P
.
aeruginosa
leading
to
the
induction
of
LPS

genes
and
resistance
to
antimicrobials
.

It
is
also
known
that
CF
airway
fluid
contains
high
levels
of
neutrophil
defensins
[
77
]
and
that
sub

lethal
doses
of
CAPs
induce
PA3553
gene
expression
,
although
independently
of
PhoPQ
and
PmrAB
[
45
]
.

The
two
-
component
regulatory
system
VicRK
or
YycFG
is
specific
for
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
.

It
is
believed
that
the
immunity
is
mediated
by
mucosal
antibodies
specific
to
SeM
and
other
protective
antigens
.

Three
putative
DeltavicK
strains
,
which
were
spectinomycin
-
resistant
and
chloramphenicol
-
sensitive
,
were
obtained
.

The
growth
factors
,
the
ratio
of
cfu
in
the
sample
at
4
h
over
cfu
at

zero
,
were
250
and
66
for
the
wild
type
and
DeltavicK
strains
,
respectively
(
Fig
.
2B
)
.

Thus
,
the
DeltavicK
mutant
has
significantly
reduced
ability
to
grow
in
rabbit
blood
(
P
<
0
.
0001
)
.

Group
of
8
mice
were
subcutaneously

with

.

Seven
of
the

equi
strain
died
,
whereas
7
of
the
8
mice
inoculated
with
DeltavicK
survived
(
Fig
.
4A
)
.

Similarly
,
these
4
mice
with
higher
IgA
levels
also
had
higher
levels
of
SeM
-
specific
systemic
IgG
(
Fig
.

)
.

S
.
equi
DeltavicK
mutant
does
not
grow
as
well
as
the
wild
-
type
strain
in
both
THY
and
blood
,
suggesting
that
the
vicK
deletion
causes
defect
in
growth
,
a
plausible
reason
that
likely
contributes
to
the
attenuation
of
S
.
equi
virulence
in
the
mouse
infection
models
.

The
DeltavicK
mutant
appears
to
possess
the
properties
of
a
potential
live
vaccine
.

To
cause
a
systemic
infection
,
Salmonella
must
respond
to
many
environmental
cues
during
mouse
infection
and
express
specific
subsets
of
genes
in
a
temporal
and
spatial
manner
,
but
the
regulatory
pathways
are
poorly
established
.

These
results
,
as
well
as
publicly
available
transcriptional
profiles
,
were
analyzed
using
both
network
inference
and
cluster
analysis
algorithms
.

We
tested
the
regulatory
model
by
expressing
a
subset
of
the
regulators
in
trans
and
monitoring
transcription
of
7
known
virulence
factors
located
within
Salmonella
pathogenicity
island
2
(
SPI
-
2
)
.

In
addition
to
fluid
and
electrolyte
loss
,
non
-
typhoidal
Salmonella
often
results
in
septicemia
in
children
and
in
HIV
infected
adults
in
developing
countries
with
a
fatality
rate
of
25
%
or
greater
[
2
]
.

Secretion
can
take
place
from
extracellular
bacteria
that
are
juxtaposed
to
the
surface
of
the
cell
or
from
intracellular
bacteria
located
in
vacuoles
.

We
have
used
SEBINI
(
Software
Environment
for
Biological
Network
Inference
;
[
18
]
)
to
directly
compare
multiple
network
algorithms
.

The
network
inference
algorithm
that
we
have
used
is
the
context
likelihood
of
relatedness
(
CLR
)
to
analyze
the
gene
expression
profiles
[
19
]
.

CLR
is
an
extension
of
the
relevance
network
class
of
machine
learning
algorithms
[
20
]
and
provides
the
highest
precision
of
several
algorithms
tested
[
19
]
.

At
a
60
%
true
positive
rate
,
CLR
identified
1
,
079
regulatory
interactions
in
E
.
coli
,
of
which
338
were
in
previously
known
networks
and
741
were
novel
predictions
(
ibid
)
.

Mutations
that
resulted
in
either
no
deaths
,
one
death
,
or
delayed
death
of
infected
mice
were
retested
with
groups
of
5
mice
at
the
same
dose
(
Figure
1A
)
.

BALB
/
c

infection
to
eliminate
other
regulators
required
only
for
gastrointestinal

or
persistence
but
most
of
these
strains
were
avirulent
in
another
strain
of
mice
(
129X1
/
SvJ
)
and
by
other
route
(
intragastric
)
of
infection
(
see
Table
S1
)
.

Therefore
the
regulators
investigated
in
this
study
might
be
considered
the
most
central
regulators
for
virulence
.

The
differences
between
our
results
and
others
are
most
likely
related
to
the
different
strains
of
Salmonella
used
in
the
studies
[
34
]
.

Mutations
of
himD
,
rpoE
,
crp
,
or
hfq
drastically
reduce
the
number
of
viable
bacteria
that
can
be
recovered
from
macrophages
even
at
short
times
(
Figure
2
)
.

We
observed
that
the
results
determined
by
these
two
methods
matched
closely
(
Figure
S2
)
and
that
the
level
of
transcription
of
ssaG
was
highest
when
Salmonella
was
grown
in
minimal
acidic
media
.

Because
the
type
III
secretion
system
and
associated
virulence
factors
encoded
within
SPI
-
2
were
most
highly
expressed
in
acidic
minimal
media
we
therefore
focused
on
growth
in
this
media
and
used
qRT
-
PCR
to
measure
transcript
levels
.

Six
promoters
have
been
identified
for
the
type
III
secretion
system
encoded
within
SPI
-
2
(
see
Figure
4
;
[
52
]
)
.

We
monitored
transcription
of
seven
genes
within
SPI
-
2
,
covering
each
operon
at
least
once
,
and
used
gyrB
transcript
as
an
internal
control
.

The
three
exceptions
were
spvR
,
fruR
,
and
rpoS
.

A
recent
study
with
E
.
coli
shows
that
the
CLR
algorithm
was
the
most
accurate
in
computing
the
correct
network
for
experimentally
verified
regulatory
interactions
[
19
]
.

Some
of
the
14
regulators
in
this
study
have
been
previously
shown
to
directly
regulate
ssrA
/
ssrB
;
OmpR
binding
to
PssrA
/
ssrB
[
60
]
,
[
61
]
;
SlyA
binding
to
PssrA
[
62
]
;
PhoP
binding
to
PssrB
[
45
]
.

As
shown
in
Figure
7D
,
slyA
is
capable
of
activating
expression
of
SPI
-
2
genes
independently
of
ssrB
,
ompR
/
envZ
,
phoP
/
phoQ
,
csrA
and
himD
(
ihf
)
,
although
the
effects
are
not
as
strong
as
ssrB
.

A
feedforward
loop
can
act
as
an
electronic
"
AND
-
gate
"
preventing
expression
except
when
two
or
more
signals
are
sensed
as
we
see
for
slyA
(
upstream
)
and
ssrB
(
downstream
)
;
fruR
(
upstream
)
and
crp
(
downstream
)
.

Mutations
in
rpoE
,
smpB
,
rpoS
,
and
hfq
showed
only
small
decreases
in
SPI
-
2
gene
transcription
during
growth
in
minimal
acidic
media
but
some
of
them
showed
large
defects
in
survival
assays
performed
in
murine
macrophages
.

Figure
6B
shows
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
these
two
regulators
and
that
they
can
both
affect
each
other
through
the
ompR
/
envZ
two
-
component
regulator
.

Similarly
SsrB
binds
upstream
of
ssrA
in
a
region
of
the
promoter
typical
of
response
regulators
but
has
no
obvious
recognition
site
and
binds
within
the
operons
that
encode
structural
components
of
the
type
III
secretion
system
[

Deletion
of
rv2623
is
not
likely
to
affect
transcription
of
neighboring
genes
,
given
the
sequence

confirmed
precise

of
the
rv2623

and
the

at
the

the
direction
opposite
to
that

)
(

.

Consequently
,
we
examined
the
virulence
of
Deltarv2623
in
the
relatively
susceptible
C3H

mouse
strain
[

.

The
results
showed
that
the
mutant
strain
was
no
more
susceptible
to
growth
inhibition
than
was
wild

Erdman
under
all

the

tested
(

.

We
began
a
biochemical
characterization
of

to
gain
insight
into
the
relationship
between
the
molecular
structure

of
this

Gel

revealed
that
the

exists
primarily
as
a
single
species
with
an
apparent
molecular
mass
of
61

1
kDa
;
suggesting
that
Rv2623
is
a

was

To

,
we
determined
the
crystal
structure
of
wild

type
Rv2623
at
a

The
structure

.

The

of

is

on

Furthermore
,

Results
of
the

indicate
that
the

is
Rv2623

.

The

The

when
the

Mechanistically
,
results
of

have
shown
that
Rv2623
regulates

RetS
belongs
to
the
family
of
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
(
TCS
)
which
translate
external
signals
into
adaptive
responses
by
a
variety
of
mechanisms
,
including
control
of
gene
expression
and
methylation
of
target
proteins
.

The
formation
of
biofilms
has
been
proposed
to
be
controlled
in
response
to
environmental
signals
[
39
]
.

Additional
stage
-
specific
events
were
detected
for
biofilms
differing
in
age
.

In
both
modes
of
growth
,
26
proteins
were
constitutively
phosphorylated
.

This
is
the
first
description
of
the
dynamic
changes
of
the
phosphoproteome
occurring
during
biofilm
development
.

We
thus
identified
48
proteins
that
were
differentially
phosphorylated
at
one
or
more
biofilm
developmental
stage
including
elongation
factors
,
ribosomal
proteins
,
several
enzymes
including
reductases
and
GMP
synthase
,
sigma
factor
RpoD
(
Suppl
.
Table

)
and
11
regulatory
proteins
(
Table

)
.

Neither
the
cognate
sensory
protein
PA5512
nor
the
response
regulator
PA4196
were
identified
in
this
study
.

We
therefore
analyzed
GacS
,
PA4101
,
and
PA4197
mutant
biofilm
phosphorylation
patterns
for
the
presence
/
absence
of
these
regulators
.

As
differential
and
sequential
phosphorylation
of
regulatory
proteins
was
detected
over
the
course
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
,
we
asked
whether
inactivation
of
these
regulatory
proteins
would
alter
or
affect
the
stage
-
specific
progression
of
biofilm
formation
.

Complementation
restored
biofilm
formation
to
wild
type
levels
(
Fig

,

)
.

However
,
when
placed
in
a
PAO1
background
(
PAO1
/
pJN5511
)
,
overexpression
of
PA5511
resulted
in
biofilms
composed
of
large
microcolonies
exceeding
250
microm
in
diameter
(
compared
to
an
average
cluster

of

The
cognate

(

is
a
typical
sensor
kinase
harboring
both
a

and
a

like
ATPase

.

TCS
mutant
biofilms
are
arrested
in
the
transition
to
later
biofilm
developmental
stages

Inactivation
of
gacS
resulted
in
the
formation
of
biofilms
following
144
hr
of
growth
that
were
similar
in
appearance
to
24
-
hr
-
old
wild
type
biofilms
.

The
phosphoproteomes
were
analyzed
using
two
approaches
,
(
i
)
immunoblot
analysis
of
whole
biofilm
cell
extracts
and
(
ii
)
LC
-
MS
/
MS
analysis
in
conjunction
with
cICAT
labeling
following
MOAC
purification
.

In
contrast
,
no
reduction
of
the
wild
type
biofilm
architecture
was
observed
(
Fig
.
5
,
Table

)
.

Mutation
in
these
regulatory
pathways
did
not
affect
initial
attachment
,
motility
,
or
Pel
and
Psl
polysaccharide
production
,
but
instead
arrested
biofilm
development
in
the
transition
from
reversible
to
irreversible
attachment
[
8
hr
to
24
hr
,
BfiRS
(
PA4196
-

)
]
,
from
initial
attachment
to
the

stage
[
(
24
hr

to
144
hr
,
MifRS
(
PA5511
-
5512
)
]
(
Fig
.

)
.

Thus
,
it
is
likely
that
inactivation
of
one
TCS
system
(
in
)
directly
results
in
altered
or
arrested
phosphorylation
patterns
and
thus
,
lack
of
phosphorylation
of
downstream
TCS
systems
(
as
observed
here
)
.

Activation

with
BfiS
phosphorylation

hours
of

GacS

GacS

.

The
finding
is
consistent
with
our
observation
of
GacS
playing
a
dual
role
in
biofilm
formation
,
with
phosphorylation
acting
as
a
switch
in
the

In

To

Consistent
with
other
class
I
secretion
chaperones
,
SrcA
has
extensive
electronegative
charge
distributed
over
the
surface
of
the
molecule
.

Thus
,
it
is
likely
that
other
surface

residues
of
SrcA
are
involved
in
these
functions
or
that
SrcA
targets
effector
cargo
to
the
secretion
apparatus
through
a
mechanism
distinct
from
CesT
.

The
interface
for
the
SrcA
homodimer
is
extensive
and
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
structural
features
of
single

interface
of
Spa15
,
a
multi

cargo
class
IB
chaperone
from
Shigella
[

These
data
suggest
that
type

chaperones
might
have
an
as
yet
undefined
role
in
assembly
of
the
ATPase
homohexamer
that
gives
rise
to
efficient

.

The

The

may
also
confer
this

Induction

Bacteria
from

showed
significantly
lower

of

These

prompted
us
to

Our

Transcriptome
Analysis
of
the
Brucella

BvrR
/
BvrS
Two
-
Component
Regulatory
System

Although
genome
sequencing
has
revealed
21
putative
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
in
the
Brucella
genus
,
the
best
characterized
one
implicated
in
virulence
is
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
.

BvrR
/
bvrS
mutants
are
avirulent
in
mice
,
have
increased
susceptibility
to
killing
by
nonimmune
serum
,
show
reduced
invasiveness
to
epithelial
cells
and
macrophages
,
and
are
incapable
of
inhibiting
lysosome
fusion
and
of
intracellular
replication
[

]
.

As
demonstrated
for
other
two
-
component
systems
,
multiple
genes
are
expected
to
be
under
the
control
of
BvrR
/
BvrS
[

]
.

Our
results
link
the
regulation
of
carbon
and
nitrogen
metabolism
to
the
expression
of
cell
envelope
components
and
suggest
the
existence
of
a
complex
regulatory
network
with
the
interplay
of
several
transcriptional
regulators
.

Results
and
Discussion

Brucella
mutants
in
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
two
-
component
regulatory
system
are
pleiotropic
[

[

]
.

A
change
in
gene
expression
was
considered
both
statistically
and
biologically
significant
if
the
p

value
was
less
than
0
.
01
.

Comparative
genome
analysis
revealed
that
in
addition
to
the
bvrR
/
bvrS
genes
,
the
genome
structure
around
these
genes
is
essentially
the
same
for
all
the
alpha
-
proteobacteria
[

]
.

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
genes
were
also
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
compared
to
parental
strain
:
BAB1

0237
,
BAB1
_
0891
(

,

,
BAB2
_
0762
(
ompR
)
,
BAB2
_
1127
and
BAB2
_
1152
.

As
we
have
show
in
this
study
,
the
expression
of
at
least
three
flagellar
genes
(

)
were
increased
also
in
the
bvrR
mutant
(

)
.

It
has
been
described
in
S

meliloti
that
exoR
gene
encodes
a
global
regulator
of
transcription
and
that
ExoR
interacts
genetically
with
both
ExoS
and
ChvI
and
inhibits

.

Virulence
and
the
adaptation
to
intracellular
growth

Most
of
the
genes
candidate
to
be
regulated
by
BvrR
/
BvrS
identified
in
our
microarray
experiments
can
be
involved
with
the
changes
needed
for
intracellular
survival
of
Brucella
.

The
amount
of
bacterial
RNA
was
not
enough
to
perform
microarray
hybridizations
.

The
secreted
Mac
protein
made
by
group
A
Streptococcus
(
GAS
)
inhibits
opsonophagocytosis
of
GAS
by
human
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
PMNs
)
.

The
gene
was
cloned
and
recombinant
SeMac
was
overexpressed
in
Escherichia
coli
and
purified
to
homogeneity
.

Horses
recovered
from
strangles
acquire
immunity
against
S
.
equi
reinfection
[
3
]
.

The
immunity
is
primarily
mediated
by
protective
antibodies
[
4
]
,
which
opsonize
and
thus
enhance
phagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

There
are
two
kinds
of
Mac
produced
by
GAS
isolates
[
7
]
,
which
use
different
mechanisms
to
block
the
interaction
between
IgG
and
Fc
receptor
on
the
surface
of
PMNs
.

No
SeMac
was
detected
in
all
the
samples
(
data
not
shown
)
,
suggesting
that
SeMac
is
not
produced
in
vitro
.

The
results
indicate
that
SeMac
is
a
cysteine
endopeptidase
,
which
uses
Cys102
,
His272
and
Asp294
as
its
catalytic
triad
to
cleave
human
IgG
.

SeMac
indeed
inhibits
the
opsonophagocytosis
of
GAS
by
human
PMNs
(
Fig
.
5B
)
.

The
residues
of
Cys102
and
His272
are
essential
and
Asp294
important
for
the
enzymatic
activity
of
SeMac
.

Although
both
SeMac
and
GAS
Mac
efficiently
cleave
human
IgG
,
they
cannot
cleave
the
majority
of
total
horse
IgG
.

This
suggests
that
SeMac
has
other
unknown
function
.
Introduction

Free
-
living
organisms
often
encounter
wide
variations
in
the
pH
of
their
surroundings
.

While
growth
in
acidic
conditions
has
been
shown
to
promote
changes
in
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
several
bacterial
species
(
Tucker
et
al
.
,
2002
;
McGowan
et
al
.
,
2003
;
Weinrick
et
al
.
,
2004
;
Leaphart
et
al
.
,
2006
)
,
less
is
known
about
the
identity
of
the
molecule
(
s
)
that
sense
extracytoplasmic
fluctuations
in
pH
and
the
mechanisms
by
which
such
sensors
promote
changes
in
gene
expression
.

The
expression
of
these
genes
has
been
shown
to
be
dispensable
for
the
acid
tolerance
response
(
Bearson
et
al
.
,
1998
)
which
suggests
that
there
are
still
uncharacterized
cellular
function
(
s
)
that
Salmonella
needs
to
regulate
in
acidic
environments
.

Results

Moreover
,
a
mutant
expressing
a
derivative
of
the
PmrA
protein
that
cannot
be
phosphorylated
due
to
substitution
of
the
putative
phosphorylation
residue
aspartate

by
alanine
(
Kato
and
Groisman
,

)
completely
failed
to

transcription
of

genes

.

,
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
pmrA
strain
(
A
.
Kato
and
E
.
A
.
Groisman
,
unpubl
.
results
)
.

From
these
results
we
conclude
that
Salmonella
harbours
a
signalling
pathway
that
responds
to
mild
acid
pH
by
activating
the
PmrA
protein
through
phosphorylation
.

The
acid
-
promoted
expression
of
the
PmrD
protein
was
phoPQ
-
dependent
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
fact
that
PhoP
is
the
only
known
direct
transcriptional
activator
of
pmrD
(
Kox
et
al
.
,
2000
)
.

While
this
mutation
severely
diminished
the
ability
of
Salmonella
to
respond
to
mild
acid
pH
,
there
still
was
some
residual
pbgP
expression
(
Fig
.
6B
)
suggesting
that
other
residues
might
also
be
required
for
pH
sensing
.

For
example
,
the
eukaryotic
G
-
protein
coupled
receptor
OGR1
is
inactive
at
pH
7
.
8
and
fully
active
at
pH
6
.
8
suggesting
that
the
pH
sensing
mechanism
involves
protonation
of
several
extracytoplasmic
histidines
(
Ludwig
et
al
.
,
2003
)
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
pKa
of
free
histidine
of
approximately6
.

Finally
,
while
a
role
for
the
PmrA
-
dependent
LPS
modifications
in
the
previously
described
acid
tolerance
response
is
unlikely
because
survival
to
acid
stress
(
pH
approximately3
)
was
not
reduced
in
cells
deficient
in
pmrA
(
data
not
shown
and
Bearson
et
al
.
,
1998
)
,
some
of
the
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
to
which
no
function
has
been
ascribed
yet
could
mediate
other
cellular
responses
to
acid
pH
.

Since
Salmonella
is
acquired
usually
by
oral
ingestion
of
contaminated
materials
,
a
key
step
in
the
infection
process
is
passage
across
the
intestinal
epithelium
by
invasion
of
M
cells
in
Peyer
'
s
patches
(
1
)
.

The
effector
proteins
mediate
actin
cytoskeleton
rearrangement
,
in
the
form
of
large
membrane
ruffles
,
which
engulf
the
bacteria
into
the
host
cell
(
4
,
5
)
.

Using
two
-
hybrid
analysis
,
it
has
been
shown
that
HilE
interacts
with
HilD
,
which
suggests
that
HilE
represses
hilA
expression
by
inhibiting
the
activity
of
HilD
through
a
protein
-
protein
interaction
(
19
,
20
)
.

SL1344
was
used
as
the
control
strain
,
and
the
invasiveness
of
this
strain
was
arbitrarily
set
at
100
%
.

When
the
Salmonella
bacteria
were
grown
in
static
cultures
to
the
exponential
phase
(
SPI1
-
inducing
condition
)
,
the
invasiveness
of
SR1304
for
both
epithelial
cell
lines
was
reduced
by
about
3
-
fold
,
compared
to
that
of
SL1344
(
Figure
1A
and
B
)
.

The
expression
levels
of
hilA
,
invF
and
hilD
,
but
not
of
hilC
,
are
decreased
in
the

Baxter
et

To
study
the
effect
of
Mlc
on
hilE
expression
,
we
measured
the
expression
of
hilE
-
lacZY
on
the
low

copy
plasmid
pMAB69
,
which
contains
the
hilE
promoter
region
from

886
to
+
121
,
relative
to
the
translation
start
site
.

The
hilE
P3
promoter
is
repressed
by
Mlc

Transcription
from
the
P3
promoter
was
increased
substantially
by
mlc
mutation
(
Figure
4B
,
lane

)
.

The
Mlc
-
His6
protein
was
produced
in
E
.
coli
and
purified
to
>
90
%
homogeneity
by
Ni2
+
affinity
chromatography
.

The
activity
of
the
purified
Mlc
-
His6
protein
was
verified
with
the
control
gel
mobility
shift
experiment
employing
the
Salmonella
ptsG
DNA
fragment
that
contains
the
known
Mlc
-
binding
site
(
data
not
shown
)
.

When
the
labeled
hilE
promoter
DNA
was
incubated
with
2
-
fold
dilutions
of
the
purified
Mlc
-
His6
protein
(
100
-
800nM
)
in
the
presence
of
the
non
-
specific
DNA
competitor
poly
dI
-
dC
,
the
concentration
-
dependent
formation
of
protein
-
DNA
complexes
was
observed
(
Figure
5A
)
.

Inspection
of
the
DNA
sequences
at
these
sites
showed
high
-
level
homology
with
the
known
consensus
Mlc
-
binding
sequence
,
which
has
the
conserved
TT
-
9bp
-
AA
motif
and
an
AT
-
rich
region
at
positions
+
/
-
7
to
+
/
-
11
,
showing
imperfect
dyad
symmetry
(

)
(
Figure

)
.

It
is
unusual
that
the
5
'
-
untranslated
region
(
UTR
)
of
mRNA
is
more
than
300nt
in
bacteria
(
42
)
.

The
UTR
of
the
hilA
gene
is
also
up
to
350nt
in
length
,
and
is
suggested
to
be
involved
in
the
complex
regulation
of
hilA
in
response
to
environmental
signals
(
8
,
12
)
.

Therefore
,
we
cannot
rule
out
the
possibility
that
additional
cis
-
or
trans
-
acting
regulatory
elements
,
which
have
not
yet
been
characterized
,
are
involved
in
hilE
expression
.

The
addition
of
excess
glucose
to
the
culture
medium
results
in
the
reduction
of
cell
association
by
S
.

We
speculate
that
the
nutrient
-
rich
LB
broth
may
mask
the
effect
of
the
sugar
on
hilE
expression
because
the
effect
of
sugar
addition
on
hilA
expression
was
more
distinct
in
DLB
than
LB
(
45
)
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
PhoR
-
PhoB
leads
to
increased
hilE
P2
expression
and
subsequent
repression
of
hilA
and
invasion
genes
(
7
,
18
)
.

Typhimurium
uses
bile
or
SCFAs
including
acetate
,
propionate
and
butyrate
,
as
environmental
signals
to
modulate
its
invasion
of
the
gastrointestinal
tract
(
50
-
52
)
.

Further
bioinformatics
analysis
revealed
a
unique
two
-
component
signal
transduction
system
(
TCSTS
)
located
in
the
candidate
89K
PAI
,
which
is
orthologous
to
the
SalK
/
SalR
regulatory
system
of
Streptococcus
salivarius
.

Notably
,
the
average
GC
content
of
salKR
,
29
.
9
%
,
is
much
less
than
that
of
both
89K
and
the
whole
genome
of
05ZYH33
(
36
.
8
%
and
41
.
1
%
,
respectively
)
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.

The
results
of
bioinformatics
analysis
indicated
that
the
response
regulator
,
SalR
,
contains
199
amino
acids
(
aa
)
with
the
three
N
-
terminal
invariant
aa
residues
(
D30
,
D54
and
K107
)
of
the
receiver
domain
of
response
regulators
from
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
[
25
]
.

One
candidate
mutant
in
which
salKR
failed
to
be
amplified
was
obtained
.

In
wild
type
strain
05ZYH33
,
the
internal
fragment
of
salKR
probe
hybridized
with
a
single
4
.
0
kb
Cla
I
fragment
(
Fig
.
3C
,
lane
1
)
,
whereas
the
SpcR
and
pUC18
probes
did
not
hybridized
with
the
genomic
DNA
(
Fig
.
3B
and
3D
,
lane
1
)
.

RT
-
PCR
experiments
later
also
showed
that
neither
salK
nor
salR
could
be
transcribed
in
DeltasalKR
(
data
not
shown
)
,
which
further
confirmed
that
salKR
had
been
deleted
from
the
bacterial
chromosome
.

Given
the
multiple
roles
of
TCSTS
in
bacteria
,
we
evaluated
the
effect
of
salKR
deletion
on
the
general
biological
characteristics
of
SS2
prior
to
in
vivo
work
.

As
shown
in
Figure
5
,
all
six
SPF
-
piglets
inoculated
intravenously
with
WT
developed
most
of
the
typical
disease
symptoms
,
including
high
fever
,
limping
,
swollen
joints
,
shivering
,
CNS
failure
and
respiratory
failure
within
24
hrs
.

To
gain
further
insights
into
the
network
/
circuit
mediated
by
SalK
/
SalR
,
whole
-
genome
DNA
microarray
was
applied
to
reveal
the
differential
transcription
profiles
between
DeltasalKR
and
WT
[
13
]
,
[
19
]
.

Genes
encoding
proteins
of
unknown
function

Bioinformatics
analysis
revealed
that
the
GC
content
of
salKR
is
far
less
than
that
of
89K
island
and
the
whole
genome
,
implying
that
this
TCSTS
is
of
foreign
origin
which
may
have
been
acquired
through
horizontal
gene
transfer
.

Secondly
,
some
of
the
TCSTSs
of
S
.
pneumoniae
were
suggested
to
be
involved
in
key
processes
of
pathogenesis
,
such
as
autolysis
and
cell
-
cell
signaling
[
52
]
,
SalK
/
SalR
might
regulate
similar
processes
in
Chinese
SS2
virulent
isolates
.

SsrB

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
RpoE
is

in

that
use
the

regulator
for

.

There
was
no
change
in
the
levels
of
SsrB
-
FLAG
between
wild
type
and
DeltarpoE
cells
(
Figure

)
,
indicating
that
the
effects
of
RpoE
on
the
four
classes
of
virulence
gene
promoters
examined
here
was
not
mediated
through
changes
to
SsrB
protein
levels
.

We
predict
that
RpoE
confers
a
similar
fine
-
tuning
effect
on
Salmonella
virulence
gene
expression
that
is
required
for
optimal
within

host
fitness
during
infection
.

Future
work
will
be
required
to
resolve
these
possibilities
.

Although
when
considered
individually
,
each
promoter
was
modestly
affected
by
deletion
of
rpoE
,
the
cumulative
effects
of
mild
rewired
inputs
on
multiple
virulence
promoters
has
been
shown
to
severely
compromise
in
-
host
fitness
and
virulence
ability

was

This

was
introduced
into
the

TB0173s
,
generating
the

.

We
thus
investigated
the
fate
of
a
cheB1

in
a
similar
assay
.

However
,
the
TB1459i
strain
(
cheB1
mutant
)
was
no
longer
able
to
move
towards
the
attractant
,
and
thus
showed
a
defect
in
this
chemotaxis
assay
(
Figure

)
.

This

was
automated
using
the

system
,
which
greatly
reduced
the
time
required
to
perform
the
assay
.

Moreover
,
it
shows
more
severe
motility
defect
than
the
cheB2
mutant
.

The
bacterial
pathogen
may
lose
its
ability
to
perceive
its
niche
due
to
the
absence
of
chemotaxis
[
62
]
.

As
previously
mentioned
,
even
though
the
cheB2
mutant
is
impaired
in
motility
,
it
is
likely
that
the
cheB2
defect
in
virulence
is
not
linked
to
this
phenotype
but
to
additional
traits
of
virulence
and
attachment
that
have
not
yet
been
determined
.

In
addition
,
the
Imd
pathway
plays
a
predominant
role
in
the
regulation
of
AMPs
in
the
alimentary
tract
and
tracheal
epithelia
[

]
.

In
addition
,
the
response
to
non
-
pathogenic
microorganisms
does
not
necessarily
reflect
a
natural
host
reaction
to
a
real
pathogen
.

Recently
we
have
developed

of

P

Secretes
an

Protease
A
common
strategy
used
by
bacterial
pathogens
is
to
secrete
toxins
and
other
virulence
factors
that
damage
host
tissues
.

The

profile
for

(
Figure

,

)
shows
a
major

band
at
51
kDa
and
several
minor
bands
.

To
test
a
possible
role
of
prtR
in
the
regulation
of
aprA
expression
,
we
analyzed
the
proteins
present
in
the
supernatant
of
prtR
mutants
.

These
data
confirmed
that
the
protease
AprA
itself
contributes
to
P

entomophila
virulence
.

Figure

shows
that

contributed
only
modestly
to

To
investigate
a
possible
in
vivo
role
of
AprA
in
the
protection
against
AMPs
synthesized
in
the
gut
,
we
compared
survival
to
P
.
entomophila
in
imd
-
deficient
flies
over
-
expressing
Attacin
A
or
Diptericin
ubiquitously
under
the
control
of
the

(

)
using
the
UAS
-
Gal4
system
(
referred
to
as
imd
;
da
>
AMP
,
Figure
S3B
)
.

Altogether
,
our
results
provide
an
in
vivo
demonstration
that
AprA
functions
in
the
protection
of
P
.
entomophila
against
Drosophila
AMPs
.

Our
analysis
reveals
that
P
.
entomophila
virulence
is
multi
-
factorial
,
as
one
might
expect
,
but
can
be
decrypted
through
genetic
analysis
of
the
two
interacting
partners
.

To
explore
the
potential
implication
of
AMPs
in
the
Imd
immune
defense
against
oral
infection
by
P
.
entomophila
,
we
compared
survival
of
flies
expressing
only
a
single
AMP
.

Thus
,
our
approach
focusing
on
both
host
and
pathogen
is
the
first
to
clearly
demonstrate
a
key
role
of
the
AprA
metalloprotease
in
the
protection
against
AMPs
in
vivo
.

This
conclusion
is
based
on
our
observations
that
(
i
)
aprA
mutants
show
attenuated
virulence
,
(
ii
)
aprA
mutants
survive
less
well
than
wild
-
type
P
.
entomophila
in
Drosophila
and
are
more
sensitive
to
Imd
-
mediated
defense
,
and
(
iii
)
AprA
provides
specific
protection
in
vivo
against
Diptericin
.

Altogether
,
our
study
reveals
that
local
AMP
expression
plays
an
important
role
in
defense
against
oral
pathogens
and
that
entomopathogens
such
as
P
.
entomophila
can
counteract
this
effect
by
expressing
aprA
.

These
behaviors
are
contingent
on
sophisticated
sensory
systems
that
maximize
fitness
in
the
complex
and
highly
dynamic
environments
where
physical
,
chemical
,
and
biological
parameters
change
on
many
different
time
scales
.

Modern
genetic
and
molecular
studies
have
largely
focused
on
a
limited
repertoire
of
behaviors
of
a
few
model
organisms
in
the
non
-
native
context
of
the
laboratory
.

The
identification
of
the
molecular
components
and
their
organization
into
the
two
dominant
modules
-
the
chemotaxis
network
and
the
flagellum
/
basal
body
/
motor
system
-
took
the
better
part
of
40
years
and
the
work
of
dozens
of
laboratories
.

These
efforts
have
culminated
in
a
level
of
understanding
nearly
unmatched
in
any
other
domain
of
molecular
biology
.

The
comprehensive
nature
of
our
methodology
is
reflected
by
the
identification
of
nearly
all
of
the
known
structural
and
regulatory
components
of
flagellar
-
mediated
chemotaxis
.

The
amplification
of
transposon
insertion
sites
from
a
small
sample
of
these
mutants
showed
that
the
nonmotile
phenotype
is
the
result
of
a
single
gene
disruption
in
each
mutant
.

To
obtain
a
genome
-
wide
catalog
of
loci
involved
in
swimming
motility
,
we
applied
our
microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
assay
to
the
population
of
mutants
at
the
end
of
the
enrichments
.

Based
on
the
hybridization
results
,
insertional
mutations
in
these
genes
should
not
measurably
impair
motility
.

Genetic
Basis
of
Swarming
Motility

After
twenty
rounds
of
daily
successive
transfers
(
Figure
3A
)
,
more
than
90
%
of
the
population
exhibited
a
defect
in
swarming
(
Figure
S5
)
.

Interrogation
of
genes
with
high
z
-
scores
in
the
enrichment
for
mutants
incapable
of
swarming
identified
two
additional
genes
that
impact
surface
motility
:
hns
,
encoding
a
global
transcriptional
regulator
,
and
yfiR
,
encoding
a
predicted
periplasmic
protein
of
unknown
function
.

These
findings
suggested
that
mutations
in
LPS
and
OPG
biosynthetic
genes
may
compromise
motility
.

To
investigate
this
possibility
,
we
introduced
flhDC
-
lacZ
translational
fusions
in
the
deletion
strains
and
performed
beta
-
galactosidase
assays
.

The
pathway
also
includes
a
recently
identified
outer
membrane
lipoprotein
(
RcsF
)
that
is
known
to
activate
the
Rcs
system
[
37
]
.

However
,
since
functional
flagella
are
a
prerequisite
for
chi
-
phage
infection
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
defects
in
LPS
and
OPG
affect
chi
-
phage
infection
directly
or
whether
the
observed
selection
results
are
primarily
due
to
reduced
flagellar
expression
.

To
test
whether
such
a
direct
role
exists
,
we
interrogated
our
collection
of
LPS
and
OPG
mutants
for
swarming
proficiency
.

In
a
genome
-
wide
effort
to
identify
suppressors
of
swimming
defects
,
additional
libraries
of
transposon
insertional
mutants
were
created
in
genetic
backgrounds
containing
gene
deletions
of
interest
.

Further
studies
are
underway
to
explore
the
functional
relationship
between
yhjH
and
these
suppressor
mutations
.

It
is
hypothesized
that
YcgR
undergoes
a
conformational
change
upon
binding
to
c
-
di
-
GMP
,
and
that
the
YcgR
-
c
-
di
-
GMP
complex
impairs
motility
through
a
protein
-
protein
interaction
with
the
flagellar
motor
[
57
]
.

Such
an
interaction
may
explain
the
observed
rotational
bias
of
flagella
in
DeltayhjH
mutants
(
Figure
6B
)
and
is
in
agreement
with
our
finding
that
mutations
in
ycgR
strongly
suppress
the
motility
defects
of
DeltayhjH
mutants
(
Figure
6F
)
.

Involvement
of
Type
1
Fimbriae
in
Swimming
Motility

This
observation
is
confirmed
by
comparing
the
motility
of
the
fimS
mutant
to
phase
ON
fimB
-
fimE
-
double
mutants
(
Figure
S11B
)
.

We
found
that
swarming
was
not
impaired
in
either
the
fimS
mutant
or
the
mutants
with
fimbria
locked
in
phase
ON
,
indicating
that
fimbria
expression
does
not
interfere
with
swarming
motility
(
Figure
S11C
)
.

We
focused
on
inhibition
of
motility
by
high
osmolarity
(
0
.
5
M
NaCl
)
,
since
previous
evidence
suggested
that
this
environmental
condition
signals
to
the
flhDC
regulatory
region
[
66
]
.

A
comparison
of
two
strains
of
the
hospital
pathogen
Enterococcus
faecalis
suggests
that
mediators
of
virulence
differ
between
strains
and
that
virulence
does
not
depend
on
mobile
gene
elements

However
,
many
,
if
not
most
,
strains
of
these
species
are
harmless
commensals
,
with
some
enterococci
being
marketed
in
Europe
to

symptoms
of
irritable
bowel
syndrome
and
recurrent
chronic

or

estimated
the
size
of
the
OG1RF
genome
as

,
825
kb
and
created
a

map
of
the

.

The
lack
of
resistance
to
common
antibiotics
facilitates
the
selection
of
plasmids
,
transposons
,
and
allelic
replacement
markers
introduced
into
the
strain
.

Also
present
is
Ace
,
a
member
of
the
MSCRAMM
(
microbial
surface
component
recognizing

family
.

The
unique
regions
were
then
characterized
further
.

The
CRISPR
(
comprised
of
regularly
interspaced
short
palindromic

)
loci
encoded
by
some
bacterial
strains
is
a
recently
described
system
that
protects
cells
from
infection
with
bacteriophage
[
25
-
27
]
.

This
indicates
that
the
location
of
the
CRISPR1
locus
appears
to
be
conserved
(
between
EF0672
and
EF0673
when
compared
with
the
V583
genome
)
.

Loss
of
the
fsr
regulatory
components
results
in

under

test
conditions
despite
the
fact
that
these
strains
still
carry
the
gelE
gene
[
23
,

]
.

We
found
two
other
MSCRAMM
proteins
that
show
polymorphisms
in
the
number
of
their
B
repeats
.

OG1RF

(

and
OG1RF

0165
(
corresponding
to
EF2224
of

has
eight
repeats
compared
to
five
in
V583
.

However
,
because
the
Symbioflor

genome
sequence
is
not
currently
available
,
it
was
not
possible
to
compare
their
respective
sequences
in
more

.

OG1RF
_

shares
82
%

with
VanRG
and
81

.

Similarly
,
OG1RF

shares
68
%
similarity
with

and

.

To
investigate
whether
the
iol
operon
was
'
inserted
into
'
or
'
removed
from
'
a
putative
ancestral
strain
,
the
sequences
surrounding
the
iol
genes
were
examined
.

However
,
the
approximately
49
kb
fragment
lacks
an
excisase
gene
and
the
probable
lantibiotic
ABC
transporter
genes
present
in
Tn5386
.

To
investigate
the
possibility
that
directly
or
indirectly
the
com
operon
might
be
responsible
for
this
phenotype
,
we
also
evaluated
transformability
by
electroporation
.

When
compared
with
OG1RF
,
transposon
mutants
[
12
]
in
the
OG1RF
equivalent
of
EF2045
(
encoding
the
comGB
homologue
)
and
in
the
OG1RF

(
encoding
the
comGF
homologue
)
showed
similar
levels
of
transformability
by
electroporation
(
data
not
shown
)
,
implying
that
the
difference
in
electroporation
efficiency
observed
between
OG1RF
and
V583
is
not
related
to
this
locus
.

A
Naturally
Occurring
Mutation
in

Suppresses
SpeB
Expression
and
Reduces
M1T1
Group
A
Streptococcal
Systemic
Virulence

This
resurgence
has
been
paralleled
by
the
emergence
of
a
globally
disseminated
GAS
cone
belonging
to
serotype
M1T1
[
3
]
-
[
5
]
.

In
this
study
we
examined
the
effect
of
a
natural
mutation
in
the
gene
encoding
the
regulator
RopB
(
also
known
as
Rgg
[
22
]
)
identified
in
a
SpeB
-
negative
GAS
clinical
isolate
.

While
such
global
differences
in
virulence
effects
could
in
part
result
from
the
differing
animal
models
used
,
it
may
also
reflect
strain
-
specific
variation
in
the
RopB
regulon
.

It
is
in
the
light
of
the
current
uncertainty
surrounding
RopB
and
its
role
in
virulence
that
we
sought
to
investigate
the
role
of
this
transcriptional
regulator
in
the
serotype
M1T1
GAS
background
that
is
the
leading
agent
of
severe
human
infection
.

Further
sequencing
was
performed
on
the
previously
described
regulators
luxS
,
rofA
,
ropA
and
ropB
[
24
]
,
[

[

.

While
the
inoculum
was
100
%
SpeB

,
bacterial

2
%
,
4
%
,
6
%
,
8
%
,
and

.

This
finding
reveals
that
when
SpeB
-
negative
colonies
are
selected
for
in
vivo
,
this
selection
is
predominantly
a
phenomenon
associated
with
CovR
/
S
inactivation
.

RopB
is
required
for
virulence
in
systemic
infection

We
have
shown
that
in

when
the

S
locus

Deletion
Mutants
in
Salmonella
:
Implications
for
Virulence
and
Global
Protein
Translation

Samples
were
analyzed
from
bacteria
grown
under
four
different
conditions
;
two
laboratory
conditions
and
two
that
are
thought
to
mimic
the
intracellular
environment
.

Post
-
transcriptional
regulation
of
gene
expression
by
small
noncoding
RNAs
(
sRNAs
)
is
widespread
in
both
prokaryotes
and
eukaryotes
and
has
only
recently
been
recognized
as
playing
a
prominent
role
in
the
regulation
of
cellular
processes
.

The
RNA
-
binding
protein
Hfq
was
initially
shown
to
be
the
host
factor
required
for
replication
of
Qbeta
RNA
bacteriophage
[
5
]
and
is
a
member
of
the
Sm
protein
family
of
RNA
binding
proteins
that
also
include
eukaryotic
proteins
required
for
mRNA
splicing
[
6
]
,
[
7
]
.

Hfq
is
a
highly
conserved
protein
encoded
within
many
bacterial
genomes
and
at
least
one
archaeon
genome
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
.

In
bacteria
,
Hfq
functions
as
a
post
-
transcriptional
regulator
that
modulates
the
stability
and
translation
of
mRNAs
chiefly
by
facilitating
sRNA
-
mRNA
interactions
[
1
]
,
[
4
]
,
[
9
]
.

tmRNA
is
found
in
a
wide
range
of
bacteria
and
in
the
mitochondria
of
some
eukaryotes
and
uniquely
exhibits
properties
of
both
tRNA
and
mRNA
[
12
]
,
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
.

Recent
reports
suggest
that
both
Hfq
and
SmpB
play
essential
roles
in
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

Identifying
what
proteins
are
actually
regulated
by
Hfq
and
SmpB
is
an
important
step
in
understanding
the
impact
of
post
-
transcriptional
gene
regulation
in
Enterobacteria
and
more
specifically
how
Hfq
and
SmpB
control
Salmonella
gene
expression
at
the
post
-
transcriptional
/
translational
level
and
the
role
that
this
may
play
in
Salmonella
pathogenesis
.

To
directly
assess
the
role
of
Hfq
and
SmpB
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
pathogenesis
,
BALB
/
c
mice
were
infected
intraperitoneally
with
200
cfu
of
either
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
,
DeltasmpB
mutant
strain
or
wildtype
strain
and
monitored
for
21
days
(
Figure
1
)
.

Mice
infected
with
wildtype
strain
exhibited
typical
symptoms
of
infection
and
died
at
around
six
days
.

Considering
the
reported
pleitropic
nature
of
deletion
of
hfq
on
the
biology
of
Salmonella
Typhimurium
it
is
likely
that
a
proportion
of
the
changes
in
protein
abundances
maybe
a
non
-
specific
and
/
or
secondary
consequence
of
hfq
deletion
.

That
is
,
not
every
deregulated
protein
in
the
hfq
mutant
strain
is
necessarily
directly
regulated
by
Hfq
.

The
"
Cellular
Processes
"
functional
category
represented
the
category
with
most
genes
impacted
by
Hfq
(
approximately63
%
)
.

However
under
SPI
-
1
inducing
conditions
(
LB
Log
)
regulation
of
SPI
-
1
proteins
by
Hfq
was
generally
consistent
with
the
literature
.

The
result
for
hfq
transcriptional
analysis
is
in
general
agreement
with
previous
studies
for
Salmonella
[
10
]
and
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
[
33
]
where
approximately20
%
and
approximately15
%
of
all
genes
,
respectively
,
were
regulated
by
Hfq
,
but
slightly
higher
than
the
number
of
Hfq
-
dependent
genes
reported
for
E
.
coli
[
27
]
and
Vibrio
cholerae
[
21
]
,
approximately6
%
each
.

The
proteins
affected
represent
a
broad
spectrum
of
Salmonella
proteins
required
for
many
biological
processes
including
general
metabolism
,
the
translational
machinery
,
stress
response
,
and
virulence
-
assocaited
processes
as
described
next
.

Other
metabolic
processes
regulated
by
Hfq
include
Fatty
acid
metabolism
(
FadA
,
FadB
,
FabA
,
FabZ
,
fbab
,
AccB
,
Acs
,
FabG
,

,

,
FabB
)
;
Arginine
catabolism
(
AstABCD
)
;
and
Propanoite
catabolism
(
PrpBCDE
)
.

Several
ribosomal
proteins
including
RpsM
,
RpsG
,
RpmD
,
and
RplN
exhibited
a
marked
reduction
in
both
protein
and
mRNA
levels
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
compared
to
the
wildtype
under
LB
Stat
growth
condition
.

The
OxyR
-
regulated
gene
dps
was
demonstrated
to
contribute
to
Salmonella
oxidative
stress
resistance
,
survival
in
macrophages
,
and
virulence
in
mice
[
38
]
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
the
periplasmic
Cu
,
Zn
-
superoxide
dismutase
sodC
to
contribute
to
Salmonella
virulence
in
mice
[
39
]
,
[
40
]
.

Microarray
analysis
showed
no
effect
on
transcription
of
these
genes
.

The
cob
operon
is
required
for
the
de
novo
biosynthesis
of
vitamin
B12
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
.

Results
from
our
proteomics
analysis
revealed
that
Hfq
regulates
the
cob
-
pdu
operon
in
AMM
-
2
(
Figure
4A
)
and
stationary
phase
(
Figure
4D
)
growth
conditions
,
with
several
products
of
the
cob
-
pdu
operon
exhibiting
increased
expression
compared
to
wild
type
.

Among
these
were
PduA
,
PduB
,
PduG
,
PduL
,
PduM
and
PduT
as
well
as
CobT
,
CbiH
,
CbiF
,
CbiC
,
and
CbiL
.

From
our
global
proteomics
analysis
we
were
able
to
observe
gene
products
for
8
of
the
13
conserved
RpoS
-
regulated
genes
,
of
which
only
a
single
protein
,
YciF
,
was
regulated
by
SmpB
.

In
order
to
accurately
characterize
global
control
of
gene
expression
at
the
post
-
transcriptional
level
it
is
essential
to
measure
global
changes
in
both
transcript
and
protein
levels
.

Using
a
sample
-
matched
procedure
our
strategy
simultaneously
measures
changes
in
global
transcript
and
protein
abundance
levels
allowing
for
a
clear
distinction
between
the
transcriptional
and
post
-
transcriptional
effects
of
Hfq
or
SmpB
.

The
result
of
this
work
was
very
surprising
namely
that
Hfq
bound
to
20
%
of
all
Salmonella
mRNA
transcripts
and
at
least
64
small
RNA
molecules
.

During
growth
in
rich
media
approximately
14
%
of
all
proteins
observed
showed
differences
in
abundance
where
as
in
acidic
minimal
media
the
result
was
approximately21
%
.

The
published
genome
sequence
of
Photorhabdus
luminescens
TT01
strain
indicates
that
virulence
genes
are
encoded
within
a
number
of
pathogenicity
islands
located
on
the
bacterial
chromosome
[
4
,
5
]
.

P
.
luminescens
produces
a
signaling
molecule
AI
-

to
resist
reactive
oxygen
species
[

]
and
phenylpropanoid
chemical
ST
to
inhibit
the
activity
of
antimicrobial
enzyme
PO
and
formation
of
melanotic
nodules
[
9
]
,
but
the
strategy
used
by
X
.
nematophila
appears
to
be
that
of
suppression
of
transcripts
involved
in
the
insect
immune
response
[
10
-

]
.

We
used
selective
capture
of
transcribed
sequences
(
SCOTS
)
technique
to
study
in
vivo
gene
expression
in
Photorhabdus
temperata
(
associated
with
the
nematode
Heterorhabditis
bacteriophora
GPS11
)
and
Xenorhabdus
koppenhoeferi
(
associated
with
the
nematode
Steinernema
scarabaei
AMK001
)
during
infection
of
the
same
insect
host
Rhizotrogus
majalis
.

Isolation
of
bacterial
transcripts
induced
in
Rhizotrogus
majalis
To
isolate
bacterial
genes
induced
upon
infection
,
total
RNA
was
isolated
from
live
grubs
at
24
h
post
injection
with
P
.
temperata
or
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
as
well
as
from
48

phase
bacterial
cultures
grown
in
Brain
Heart
Infusion
(
BHI
)
broth
that
were
used
to
inject
R
.
majalis
.

The
coverage
of
in

enriched
libraries
was
then
evaluated
using
Analytic
Rarefaction
according
to
the
redundancy
of
each
identical
transcript
in
the
sequenced
clones
.

Twenty
nine
of
the
40
distinct
P
.
temperata
transcripts
have
similar
sequences
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
genome
,
thus
11
were
P

temperata
specific
;
30
of
the
39
distinct
X
.
koppenhoeferi
transcripts
share
sequence
similarity
with
P

temperata
genome
,
thus
9
were
specific
to
X

koppenhoeferi
(
Tables

and

)
.

As
depicted
in
the
conceptual
molecular
model
(
Fig

)
,
apart
from
a
relatively
small
number
of
common
strategies
used
by
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
to
cause
infection
of
R
.
majalis
,
most
upregulated
genes
were
different
between
the
two
bacteria
,
suggesting
vastly
different
pathways
to
bring
about
infection
of
the
same
insect
host
.

Flagellum
-
mediated
motility
may
provide
an
advantage
for
infection
by
attachment
to
the
host
surface
[
19
,
20
]
,
whereas
it
has
been
reported
in
X
.
nematophila
that
the
expression
of
virulence
factors
is
not
controlled
by
the
regulation
of
flagella
motility
[
21
]
.

Gene
dacC
encoding
a
peptidoglycan
synthesis
enzyme
D
-
alanyl
-
D
-
alanine
carboxypeptidase
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
but
not
in
P
.
temperata
,
implying
that
peptidoglycan
undergoes
structural
alterations
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
that
probably
add
to
its
fitness
when
residing
in
the
host
.

Facing
stimuli
,
different
regulatory
genes
were
upregulated
in
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
reflecting
their
unique
ability
to
respond
to
environmental
challenges
.

Responding
to
low
Mg2
+
levels
,
phoP
expression
is
auto
-
regulated
by
PhoP
and
PhoQ
proteins
and
phoQ
is
constitutive
[
25
]
.

Besides
transcriptional
regulatory
genes
,
gene
tilS
,
encoding
a
putative
cell
cycle
protein
[
4
]
,
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

The
tca
gene
family
encodes
four
toxin
complexes
TcaA
,
TcaB
,
TcaC
and
TcaD
[
33
]
,
and
has
been
found
in
several
bacterial
pathogens
including
P
.
luminescens
,
Yersinia
and
Xenorhabdus
[
34
]
.

Further
,
genes
encoding
components
of
different
types
of
secretion
machineries
were
isolated
in
this
study
.

Notably
,
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
virH
with
sequence
similarity
to
a
gene
encoding
putative
toxin
secretion
transporter
in
Vibrio
cholera
,
was
upregulated
during
infection
of
R
.
majalis
.

In
addition
,
several
other
genes
encoding
proteins
with
putative
virulence
functions
identified
in
this
study
may
represent
novel
toxin
candidates
involved
in
insect
infection
.

Gene
surA
is
important
for
bacterial
survival
during
infection
[
41
,
42
]
to
avoid
accumulation
of
non
-
native
protein
conformations
[
42
-
44
]
,
and
uspB
gene
product
is
usually
accumulated
in
the
stationary
phase
and
probably
important
for
ethanol
stress
[
45
]
.

The
glutathione
synthetase
gene
gshB
which
mediates
condensation
of
gamma
-
glutamylcysteine
and
glycine
to
form
glutathione
[
47
,
48
]
was
induced
in
P

temperata
,
but
glutathione
reductase
gene
gor
which
reduces
glutathione
disulfide
to
the
sulfhydryl
form
of
glutathione
[
47
,
48
]
was
induced
in
X

koppenhoeferi
.

Induction
of
different
amino
acid
biosynthetic
genes
may
suggest
the
differences
in
amino
acid
requirements
in
the
two
bacteria
during

.

Isolation

temperata
def
,
encoding
an
amino

may
reflect
the
importance
of
specific
amino
acids
involved
in
the
translation
process
during
growth
in
the
insect
host
.

Also
supported

Conclusion

Our
results
indicate
that
,
for
example
,
gene
apxIVA
from
an
operon
coding
for
RTX
toxin
ApxIV
is
highly
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
,
and
that
two
genes
from
the
operon
coding
for
type
IV
fimbriae
(
APL
_
0878
and
APL
_
0879
)
were
also
up
-
regulated
.

Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae
is
the
causative
agent
of
porcine
pleuropneumonia
,
a
highly
contagious
respiratory
disease
that
causes
great
economic
losses
worldwide
[
1
]
.

Fifteen
different
serotypes
can
be
identified
based
on
differences
in
capsular
polysaccharides
.

While
serotypes
1
to
12
and
15
usually
belong
to
biotype
1
,
which
contains
strains
that
are
NAD
-
dependent
,
serotypes
13
and
14
are
usually
NAD
-
independent
and
belong
to
biotype
2
[

]
.

More
recently
,
SCOTS
experiments
were
conducted
with
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
at
two
different
stages
of
infection
:
at
the
end
of
the
acute
stage
,
in
necrotic
lung
tissues
(
7
days
post
-
infection
)
[
18
]
,
and
in
the
chronic
stage
(
21
days
post
-
infection
)
[
10
]
.

These
studies
demonstrated
the
importance
of
anaerobic
metabolism
and
HlyX
-
regulated
mechanisms
during
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
infection
in
the
lungs
,
and
led
to
the
identification
and
characterisation
of
a
maturation
autotransporter
protease
,
AasP
,
responsible
for
cleavage
and
release
of
fragments
of
OmlA
from
the
cell
surface
[
19
]
.

During
the
course
of
our
experiments
,
we
were
able
to
collect
samples
from
three
different
animals
from
the
same
herd
,
before
antibiotherapy
was
undertaken
to
eradicate
the
infection
.

Tissues
were
homogenized
with
1
.
0
mm
zirconia
/
silica
beads
to
release
but
not
lyse
bacterial
cells
from
the
tissue
.

Approximately
20
to
45
mug
of
total
RNA
could
routinely
be
extracted
from
approximately
2
g
of
necrotic
lung
tissue
,
with
no
apparent
contamination
by
eukaryotic
RNA
,
as
observed
on
agarose
gel
when
using
bacterial
RNA
extracted
from
BHI
broth
and
eukaryotic
RNA
recovered
from
porcine
lung
epithelial
cells
(
SJPL
cell
line
)
[
27
]
as
on
-
gel
controls
(
data
not
shown
)
.

This
condition
was
not
only
chosen
for
practical
reasons
,
but
also
to
fulfill
two
precise
objectives
:
first
,
to
allow
for
the
identification
of
genes
that
,
while
important
to
the
infection
process
,
have
not
been
identified
previously
in
vitro
in
rich
medium
,
and
second
,
to
allow
comparison
of
the
results
obtained
in
vivo
to
those
obtained
in
our
laboratory
in
other
growth
conditions
by
keeping
the
same
reference
[
28
-
30
]
.

Five
of
these
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
(
sohB
,
hbpA
,
kpsF
,
apxIVA
,
phoR
)
and
six
were
down
-
regulated
(
nlpI
,
visC
,
proQ
,
APL
_
1456
,
APL
_
1135
and
nusG
)
.

It
is
also
the
only
apx
gene
that
was
up
-
regulated
in
our
experiment
,
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
apxIBCD
and
apxIIAB
genes
,
although
not
differentially
expressed
,
were
all
actively
transcribed
in
vivo
.

Finally
,
the
last
gene
that
was
up
-
regulated
in
our
study
and
identified
in
another
in
vivo
study
is
nanE
,
which
codes
for
a
putative
N
-
acetylmannosamine
-
6
-
phosphate
2
-
epimerase
,
an
enzyme
involved
in
the
use
of
N
-
acetylneuraminate
and
N
-
acetylmannosamine
as
carbon
sources
[
35
]
.

It
is
believed
to
form
a
complex
with
sRNAs
and
RNAse
E
,
thereby
targeting
mRNAs
that
are
recognized
by
sRNAs
for
degradation
.

Studies
in
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
it

Conclusions

Mutational

of
a

validated
this

as
the
minimal

needed
for

To
begin
to
understand
regulatory

and

of
the
SsrB

,
we
profiled
the
transcriptome
of
an
ssrB

and
compared
it
to
S
.

This
included
almost
all
genes
in
the
SPI

as
well
as
effector

encoded

(

.

Next
,
we
performed
a

[

on
the

that

Among

were
distributed

To
expand
on

,
we

We

,
,
however

made

Interestingly
,
two
copies
of
the
palindrome
occur
upstream
of
the

operon
in
S
.

However
,
if
the
two

were
swapped

to

back
so
that
they
maintained

(

)
,

was
restored
.

This
analysis
recovered
the
motifs
upstream
of
ssaB
,
ssaG
,
ssaM
,
and
ssaR
that
were
used
to
generate
the
PWM
.

Remarkably
,
this
accounted
for
17
of

encoded
effectors
translocated
by

are

and

,
and

and

)
.

For
the
IGR
palindrome
upstream
of
ssaR
,
we
tested
both
a
chromosome
-
integrated
transcriptional
fusion
and
an
autonomous
episomal
reporter
.

In
doing
so
we
believe
that
the
nineteen
operons
containing
differentially
expressed
genes
determined
by
microarray
and
containing
a
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
peak
three
standard
deviations
above
the
mean
captured
by
this
analysis
represent
the
genes
directly
activated
by
SsrB
(
Table

)
.

The
SsrB
ortholog
in
S
.
glossinidius
is
approximately30
%
divergent
with
SsrB
at
the
protein
level
,
initially
leading
us
to
think
that
they
might
have
different
binding
site
preferences
.

To
the
contrary
,
high
local
conservation
in
the
promoters
evolved
in
Salmonella
and
Sodalis
was
the
crux
in
defining
the
functional
SsrB
input
among
stochastic
noise
.

With
the
structure
of
SsrB
available
[
32
]
and
its
recognized
sequence
now
identified
,
future
studies
will
be
able
to
build
a
picture
of
how
SsrB
interacts
with
both
its
target
DNA
,
RNA
polymerase
and
potentially
other
transcription
factors
including
nucleoid
associated
proteins
in
order
to
direct
transcription
of
its
regulon
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
the
engagement
of
unique
regulatory
modules
in
niche
adaptation
,
implicate
a
critical
role
for
bacterial
genetic
heterogeneity
that
surpasses
transcriptional
in
vivo
adaptation
,
and
portray
the
dynamics
underlying
the
selection
of
hypervirulent
covS
mutants
over
their
parental
WT
cells
.

Subsequent
studies
uncovered
that
this
genetic
switch
is
driven
by
host
innate
immune
pressure
that
selects
for
bacteria
with
pathoadaptive
mutations
in
the
covRS
genetic
locus
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
.

Despite
the
association
between
covS
mutations
and
the
emergence
of
the
hypervirulent
phenotype
of
M1T1
strains
,
it
is
unclear
whether
this
increased
virulence
can
be
entirely
attributed
to
the
modulation
of
the
CovR
regulon
or
if
other
networks
are
also
perturbed
in
vivo
directly
,
indirectly
,
or
independently
of
the
CovRS
system
.

Such
comprehensive
analyses
highlighted
the
behavior
of
genomic
subsystems
that
may
be
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
S
.
pyogenes
niche
adaptation
and
pathogenesis
.

The
difference
in
buoyancy
can
also
be
attributed
to
differences
in
the
expression
of
hyaluronic
acid
capsule
(
AP
>
WT
)
.

Minimal
media
are
not
optimal
for
the
expression
of
GAS
proteins
,
which
may
explain
why
GAS
failed
to
grow
at
many
of
the
PM
conditions
(
Fig
.
S1
)
and
why
fewer
phenotypic
differences
were
observed
between
WT
and
AP
bacteria
than
transcriptomic
differences
(
see
below
)
.

We
extracted
RNA
from
these
bacteria
immediately
after
their
recovery
from
mouse
chambers
with
no
additional
culturing
and
used
the
extracted
RNA
for
transcriptome
profiling
as
detailed
in

Multiple
approaches
to
microarray
analysis
show
statistically
significant
and
biologically
relevant
differences
between
the
WT
and
AP
populations
in

and
in
vivo

By
clustering
normalized
expression
values
from
different
biological
replicates
in
all
data
sets
,
we
generated
an
overall
"
pathovivogram
"
that
includes
276
genes
in
ten
coexpression
clusters
,
CCs
(
Fig
.

,
Fig
.
S2
,
and
Table
S1
)
.

Moreover
,
we
identified
a
unique
cluster
,
CC7
,
that
includes
genes
upregulated
both
in
vivo
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
covS
mutation
(

,
those
encoding

and

)
,

.

The
patterns
in
clusters
CC1

CC3
describe
those
gene
sets
whose
transcription
was
turned
on
(
CC1
-
CC2
)
or
off
(
CC3
)
to
drive
the
bacterial
adaptation
to
the
host
environment
,
but
are
not
primarily
related
to
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

By
contrast
,
the
most
dramatic
transcriptional
reprogramming
was
that
exhibited
by
the
WT
bacteria
in
their
attempt
to
adapt
to
the
in
vivo
environment
(
Table
2
)
.

However
,
the
fold
-
change
in
SpeB
operon
transcription
level
largely
varied
across
the
four
experimental
conditions
,
ranging
from
a
2

2
-
fold
to
a
30
-
fold
downregulation
(
Table

)
.

The
next
stage
in
our
analysis
was
to
integrate
microarray
data
,
moving
from
the
gene
/
cluster
level
to
the
level
of
biological
subsystems
.

Group
A
streptococcal
sociomicrobiology
It
is
now
well
established
that
bacterial
populations
often
consist
of
heterogeneous
communities
rather
than
genetically
identical
cells
with
synchronized
gene
expression
profiles
[
49
]
,
[
50
]
,
[
51
]
.

In
this
study
,
we
captured
dynamic
events
underlying
the
phenotypic
switch
resulting
from
this
population
restructuring
.

SpeB
is
a
major
virulence
factor
in
GAS
pathogenesis
and
its
expression
is
regulated
by
different
systems
[
40
]
,
[
56
]
,
[
57
]
,
[
58
]
,
including
the
CovRS
system
[
20
]
,
[
53
]
.

Whereas
SpeB
expression
may
be
important
in
the
initial
stages
of
skin
infections
[
29
]
,
[
35
]
,
its
downregulation
has
been
associated
with
an
invasive
and
hypervirulent
phenotype
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
,
[
59
]
.

The
downregulation
of
GRAB
makes
biological
sense
because
this
protein
binds
alpha
-
2
-
macroglobulin
in
blood
[
60
]
to
protect
the
bacteria
against
its
own
protease
,
SpeB
,
and
thus
the
bacteria
no
longer
need
to
express
high
levels
of
GRAB
when
SpeB
is
not
expressed
.

However
,
coexpression
analysis
alone
can
miss
some
biologically
relevant
genes
that
could
fail
the
statistical
tests
for
non
-
biological
reasons
(
e
.
g
.
,
poorly
hybridizing
probes
,
low
signal
-
to

noise
ratio
,
or
high
variance
)
and
may
instead
include
some
irrelevant
genes
in
isolation
of
their
biological
networks
[
41
]
.

In
bacteria
,
biochemical
pathways
,
virulence
systems
,
and
multimeric
proteins
are
often
encoded
next
to
each
other
by
chromosomally
contiguous
or
clustered
genes
[
64
]
,
[
65
]
.

Similarly
,
the
common
use
of
statistical
constraints
with
ratio
calculation
(
e
.
g
.
,
two
-
fold
ratios
and
P
values
<
0
.
05
)
filters
out
many
biologically
relevant
genes
that
are
true
positives
.

Having
used
multiple
strategies
and
integrated
the
PM
data
with
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
microarray
data
,
we
propose
the
following
hypotheses
about
streptococcal
niche
adaptation
and
switch
to
hypervirulence
:
(
1
)
Exposure
to
the
in
vivo
environment
perturbs
a
substantial
number
of
GAS
genes
and
regulatory
networks
.

This
is
why
we
believe
that
transcriptional
reprogramming
by
environmental
adaptation
alone
was
insufficient
to
provide
WT
bacteria
with
an
in
vivo
survival
advantage
.

We
believe
that
our
results
offer
a
proof
of
principle
that
in
vivo
-
extracted
RNA
can
provide
transcriptional
profiles
that
better
reflect
the
complexity
of
heterogeneous
bacterial
communities
,
and
,
as
shown
in
this
study
,
can
provide
a
transcriptional
snapshot
of
a
bacterial
population
right
before
its
extinction
.

The
use
of
in
vivo
-
driven
RNA
in
understanding
virulence
has
been
appreciated
in
streptococcal
research
[
73
]
,
but
the
technique
has
not
previously
been
used
to
explain
the
switch
to
hypervirulent
,
invasive
phenotypes
or
to
dissect
heterogeneous
microbial
subpopulations
.

Conformationally
modified
RR
molecule
functions
as
transcriptional
regulator
(

or
repressor
)
by
binding
with

regions
of
the

through

(

.

HK06

was
also
important
for
the
ability
of
pneumococci
to
adhere
to
epithelial

in

and
to
survive
and
proliferate
in
an
in

[

.

In
this

,
the

has

with
the

with

according
to

Construction

of

At
the

the

slightly
differed
from
the

of

.

Several

were
used
to
prepare

of

and

As

was
found
to
be
most
effective
with
respect
to
higher

and
quality
of
the

observed
after

(

.

,
the

caused

significantly
differed
in
comparison
with
that
caused
by
the
wild

type
and
sak188
mutant
strains
.

Compared
to
the
wild

,
the
differences
in
virulent

were
statistically
significant
in
case
of
sak189

(

,
and
not
significant
in

of

(

)
.

However
,
the

of

has
not
been

In

(

with

)
,
which
binds

region
of
cbpA
,
repressed
transcription
of
the

[

.

This
is
not
surprising
given
the
high

in
the
sequences
,

and
relative
locations
of
Sak188

Sak189
and
HK06

,
and
beta

(

)
.

Thus
,
we
can
conclude
that
sak188
and
bac

are
not
in
the
operon
,
and
repression
of
bac
gene
transcription
in
sak189

is
not
due
to
the
polar

.

It
could
be
predicted
given
that

resulted
in
the

of

,
however
,
in
all
these

the

became
less
virulent
compared
to
the
wild

METHODS
:
The
effect
of
insulin
on
VEGF
expression
in
vivo
was
examined
by
in

hybridization
studies
of
rat
retinal
VEGF
transcripts
.

Intensive
insulin
therapy
may
cause
a

worsening
of

in
patients

expression
.

Both

and
were
followed
until

The
latent

protein
LMP1
of
Epstein

(
EBV
)
is
often
present
in
EBV
-
associated
malignancies
including
nasopharyngeal
carcinoma
and
Hodgkin

s
lymphoma
.

Furthermore
,
LMP1
cooperates
with
a
p16
-
insensitive
CDK4
(
R24C
)
oncogene
in
transforming
MEF
cells
.

The
ras

transformed
,
ATX

secreting
subclones
had
enhanced
motility
to

as
chemoattractant
,
but
there
was
little
difference
in
the
motility
responses
of
NIH3T3
cells

The
second
most
prevalent
urological
malignancy
in
middle
aged
and
elderly
men
is
bladder
cancer
,
with
90
%
of
the
cases
being
transitional
cell
carcinomas
.

In
addition
,
most
of
these
agents
require
instrumentation
of
the
urinary
tract
and
are
delivered
at
a
significant
cost
and
potential
morbidity
to
the
patient
.

The
hypothesis
that
modifications
of
activity
and
/
or
expression
of
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
isozymes
might
play
a
role
in
these
modifications
,
via
enhanced
local
production
of
nitric
oxide
,
was
tested
in
this
study
.

Peritoneal
NOS
activity
is
increased
fivefold
in
long
-
term
PD
patients
compared
with
control
subjects
.

This
study
uses
quantitative
histomorphometry
and
double
-
immunohistologic
detection
techniques
for
the
demarcation
of
proliferating
endothelial
cells
,
to
show
that
synchronized
hair
follicle
cycling
in
adolescent
C57BL
/
6
mice
is
associated
with
substantial
angiogenesis
,
and
that
inhibiting
angiogenesis
in
vivo
by
the
intraperitoneal
application
of
a
fumagillin
derivative
retards
experimentally
induced
anagen
development
in
these
mice
.

Thus
,
angiogenesis
is
a
physiologic
event
in
normal
postnatal
murine
skin
,
apparently
is
dictated
by
the
hair
follicle
,
and
appears
to
be
required
for
normal
anagen
development
.

After
incubation
for
4
days
,
the
medium
from
the
coculture
system
is
collected
.

A
tumor
'
s
ability
to
successfully
metastasize
may
be
dependent
on
mediators
generated
in
the
tumor
-
host
interaction
,
and
may
not
be
just
an
independent
characteristic
of
the
tumor
itself
.

Following
proteolysis
,
it
is
thought
that
the
intracellular
portion
of
Notch
(
N
(
ic
)
)
translocates
to
the
nucleus
,
where
it
is
involved
in
regulating
gene
expression
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
suggest
that
CD40
expression
on
lung
cancer
may
play
a
role
in
metastatic
spread
,
and
also
may
serve
as
a
prognostic
marker
and
an
indicator
of
advanced
disease
.

Using
univariate
analysis
,
the
S
-
100beta
level
and
metastatic
profile
were
found
to
be
statistically
significant
prognostic
factors
for
survival
.

BACKGROUND
:
Neurotrophins
mediate
their
effects
by
binding
to
members
of
the
Trk
family
of
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
and
to
the
low

.

Apoptotic

by
p75
was
ligand

and
only
partly
caspase

.

The

they
release
in
its

are
pivotal
in

the

Mutation
of

play
an

in
the
high

of

The

line
,
IF6
,
which
does
not
express
uPA
,
provided
further
confirmation
of
PAI

and
uPA
'
s
role
as
,
upon

with

,
this

attained
an

,
which
was

HSP27
is
implicated
in
protein
-
protein
interactions
such
as
folding
,
translocation
,
and
prevention
of
inappropriate

.

The
issue
is
complicated
because
both
disorders
have
a
propensity
for
MDS
or
AML
as
part
of
their
natural
history
.

To
determine
if
hypoxic
activation
of
these
stress
activated
protein
kinases
regulated
HIF

1alpha
and
VEGF
expression
,
we
assayed
JNK1
and
p38
activity
in
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
SCC
)
lines
grown
under
normoxic
or
hypoxic
conditions
.

Overexpression
of
JNK1
or
p38
was
sufficient
to
induce
HIF

and
VEGF
expression
.

Prolonged

led
to
the

of

of
the

,
which
was
mediated
mainly
by

.

Interestingly
,
Dss1

was
also
shown
to
be
elevated
in

relative
to

further
increased
in

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
try
to
understand
why

are
resistant
to

and
determine
the
signaling
pathway
utilized
by
AdGFPFasL
(
TET
)
to
induce
apoptosis
in
these
Fas
-
resistant
cells
.

Using
immunoblot
analysis
,
we
show
that
AdGFPFasL
(
TET
)
is
capable
of
initiating
the
classic
Fas
-
mediated
apoptotic
pathway
in
DU145
cells
,
which
includes
activation
of

(

is
an
important

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
the
effect
of
the
expression
and
mutation
of
c
-
kit
gene
and
its
relationship
with
clinical
pathology
and
prognosis
of
gastrointestinal

(
GIST
)
.

METHODS
:
Immunohistochemical
and
PCR
-
SSCP
techniques
were
used
to
detect
c
-
kit
protein
expression
and
c
-
kit
gene
exon
11
mutation
in
82
patients
with
GIST
.

Altogether
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
glycolytic
pathway
may
be
an
important
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
to
sensitize
tumor
cells
to
selectively
toxic
soluble
death
ligands
or

-
expressing
cells
of
the
immune
system
by
facilitating
the
activation
of

-

.

This
may
explain
why
some
patients
remain
without
symptoms
or
signs
of
ischemia
.

This
remodeling
process
seems
to
be
mainly
flow
-
mediated
.

In
addition
,
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
prostaglandin
E
(

)
(
PGE
(

)
immunoassay
were
performed
to
verify
whether
BV
possesses
an
inhibitory
effect
on
the
expression
of
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
and
PGE
(
2
)
synthesis
.

Expression
of
COX
-
2
mRNA
and
synthesis
of
PGE
(
2
)
were
inhibited
by
BV
.

Injection
of
indomethacin
,
a
nonselective
COX
inhibitor
,
on
the
day
of
ovulation
and
the
following
day
decreased
serum
levels
of
progesterone
,
as
did
injection
of
the
selective
COX
-
II
inhibitor
NS
-
398
.

None
of
the
inhibitors
had
any
effect
on
the
weight
of
the
superovulated
ovaries
or
on
the
synthesis
of
progesterone
by
cultured
luteal
cells
.

By

of

and
in

melanomas
.

The
effects
of
LMP1
on
the
invasion
and
migration
of
CNE1
cells
were
investigated
by
transwell
methods
.

The
increased
expression
of
MMP
-
9
was
also
shown
in
CNE1
-
GL
cells
by
Western

analysis
.

The
hypothesis
was
that
therapy
with
NH
(
2
)
-
terminally
truncated
form
of
galectin
-
3
(
galectin
-
3C
)
will
be
efficacious
for
reduction
in
tumor
growth
and
for
inhibition
of
metastases
.

The
p53
and
VEGF
staining
statuses
were
coincident
in
only
21
%
of
the
tumors
,
and
no
significant
correlation
was
found
between
p53
and
VEGF
statuses
.

Conversely
,
expression
of
pAd
-
T34A
caused
apoptosis
in
umbilical
vein
and
dermal
microvascular
endothelial
cells
and
resulted
in
caspase
-
3
activity
.

Cell
death
induced
by
survivin
targeting
exhibited
the
hallmarks
of
mitochondrial
-
dependent
apoptosis
with
release
of
cytochrome
c
and
loss
of
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
was
suppressed
in
Apaf
-

or
caspase
-
9
knockout
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
.

When
injected
in
human
breast
cancer
xenografts
,
pAd
-
T34A
inhibited
growth
of
established
tumors
and
triggered
tumor
cell
apoptosis
in

.

Following

complexes
(

)
into
mice
,

(

occurs
predominantly
in
the
lungs
.

This
aggregation
process
was
irreversible
and
was
inversely
correlated
with
the
percentage
of
lung
cells
that
took
up
lipoplexes
and
with
the
efficiency
of
lipofection
.

Angiogenic
activity
of

This
review
focuses
on
the
application
of
therapeutic
angiogenesis
for
treating
ischemic
muscle
disease
and
includes
a
critical
evaluation
of
the
parameters
and
limitations
of
current
procedures
.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
is
a
mitogen
that
acts
exclusively
on
endothelial
cells
.

The
roles
of
miscrovascularity
density
(
MVD
)
and
VEGF
expression
in
the
progression
of
oral
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
OSCC
)
have
been
controversial
.

This
chapter
focuses
on
the
morphology
of
blood
vessel
formation
in
and
around
the
early
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
,
i
.
e
.
,
brain
and
spinal
cord
)
of
avian
embryos
.

We
discuss
cell
lineages
,
proliferation
and
interactions
of
endothelial
cells
,
pericytes
and
smooth
muscle
cells
,
and
macrophages
.

Due
to
space
limitations
,
we
can
not
review
the
molecular
control
of
CNS
angiogenesis
,
but
refer
the
reader
to
other
chapters
in
this
book
and
to
recent
publications
on
the
assembly
of
the
vasculature
(
1
,
2
)
.

It
is
proposed
that
the
switch
from
tumor
suppressor
to
oncogene
reflects
genetic
or
epigenetic
alterations
in
signaling
pathways
in
tumor
cells
that
alter
the
readout
from
the
TGFbeta1
pathway
.

Clinical
,
laboratory
,
histopathological
,
and
pharmacological
evidence
support
the
notion
that
the
coagulation
system
,
which
is
activated
in
most
cancer
patients
,
plays
an
important
role
in
tumor
biology
.

This
event
is
independent
of
fibrin
formation
.

Thrombin
decreases
the
ability
of
endothelial
cells
to
attach
to
basement
membrane
proteins
.

These
results
could
explain
the
angiogenic
and
tumor
-
promoting
effect
of
thrombin
and
provide
the
basis
for
development
of
thrombin
receptor
mimetics
or
antagonists
for
therapeutic
application
.

Little
,
however
,
is
known
about
the
inhibitory
mechanisms
.

Pak1
-
DLC1
interaction
plays
an
essential
role
in
cell
survival
,
which
depends
on
Pak1
'
s
phosphorylation
of
DLC1
on
Ser88
.

The
proportion
of
SMCs
surviving
in
the
implanted
region
was
greater
(
P
less
than

05
)
in
the
IGF
-

-
transfected
group
than
in
the
vector
or
cell
controls
.

It
suggests
that
altered
PTEN
gene
contributes
to
tumorigenesis
and
progression
of
gastric
carcinomas
.

Granulocyte

-
stimulating

and
interleukin

enhance
the
incorporation
of

arabinoside
into
the
DNA
of
leukemic
blasts
and
the
cytotoxic
effect
on
clonogenic
cells
from
patients
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
.

In
contrast
,
MCT

was
the
predominantly
expressed
isoform
in
normal

.

The
molecular
mechanisms
regulating
the
gene
expression
under
hypoxic
conditions
could
increase
the
therapeutic
window
of

systems
.

In
this
study
,
to
examine
hypoxia

specific
production
of
anti

angiogenic
therapeutic
gene
,
we
constructed
5
copies
of
HRE
(

)
of
human

linked
to

Tie2
(
sTie2
)
driven
by
minimal
SV40
promoter
(

/

)
.

The
increased
expressions
of
these
proteins
in
Galpha
(
12
)
QL
cells
were
validated
by
immunoblot
analysis
.

An
immunohistochemical
score
based
on
the
intensity
of
immunoreactivity
and
proportion
of
immunoreactive
cells
was
established
for
each
MMP
and

.

Neuroblastoma
is
derived
from

.

In
a

of
neuroblastomas
,
a

occurs
in

adjacent
to

This

shows
that
angiogenin

is
up

regulated
in
the
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
compartments
in
in

compared
with

In

the

locus

a

,
termed
p12

expressed
in

ARF
,
a
protein
encoded
by
an
alternative

that
acts
as
a
tumor
suppressor
through
the
p53
pathway
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
INK4B
locus
,
similarly
to
INK4A
-
ARF
,
harbors
two
different
splicing
variants
that
can
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
both
the

the
two

These

make
such

The

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
findings
suggest
that
transcriptional
repression
of
HRK
is
caused
by
promoter
hypermethylation
in
PCNSL
,
and
that
the
loss
of
HRK
associated
with
the
methylation
profile
of
other
genes
is
a
potential
step
in
the
modulation
of
cellular
death
by
apoptosis
during
PCNSL
tumorigenesis
.

In

studies
using
monolayer
cultures
of

have
shown
that
2
-
DG
selectively
inhibits
energy
-
dependent
DNA
repair
and
cellular
recovery
processes
in
cancer
cells
.

Comet
assay
revealed
a
late
onset
of
DNA
breaks
in
the
presence
of
2
-
DG
following
irradiation
only
in
spheroids
,
which
corroborated
well
with
the
late
onset
of
oxidative
stress
.

No

have
been
developed
sofar
to
enhance
blood

in
the
legs
of
patients
with
peripheral

(
PAD
)
.

Considering
the
relatively
few
number
of
patients
treated
by
angiogenic
therapy
,
the
interpretation
of
clinical
results
needs
cautiousness
.

Six
edentulous
patients
(
aged
60
+
/
-
9
years
)
with
a
severely
atrophic
mandible
underwent
bone

with
distraction

.

Two
distraction
rates
(
0
.
5
and
1
mm
/
day
)
were
compared
and
for
each
group
three
patients
were
analyzed
.

Histological
analysis
demonstrated
the
presence
of
blood
vessels
throughout
the
soft
connective
tissue
in
the
distraction
gap
.

It
is
synthesised
and
secreted
by
the
ciliary
body
epithelium
(
CBE
)
from
the
initiation
of
CBE
development
in
the
embryo
,
and
production
continues
throughout
life
.

METHODS
:
Immunohistochemistry
was
used
to
determine
the
distribution
of
opticin
in
normal
human
CBE
,
and
in
hyperplastic
and
neoplastic
CBE
lesions
.

Our
data
indicates
that
this
therapeutic
approach
markedly
promotes
angiogenesis
and
granulation
tissue
formation
in
comparison
with
other
conditions
14
days
after
wounding
.

Because
of
this

and
the
virtual
explosion
of
interest
in
pomegranate
as
a

and
nutritional
product
that
has
followed
,
this
review
is
accordingly
launched
.

The

,
possesses
a
vast

history
and
represents
a

Tsg101
is
upregulated
in
a

of
invasive
human
breast
cancers
and
its
targeted
overexpression
in
transgenic
mice
reveals
weak
oncogenic
properties
for
mammary
cancer
initiation
.

Previous
studies
reported
that
the
Tumor
Susceptibility
Gene
101
(
TSG101
)
is
upregulated
in
selected
human
malignancies
,
and
the
expression
of
exogenous
Tsg101
was
suggested
to
transform
immortalized
fibroblasts
in
culture
.

To
date
,
the
potential
oncogenic
properties
of
Tsg101
have
not
been
examined
in
vivo
owing
to
the
lack
of
appropriate
model
systems
.

The
overexpression
of
Tsg101
resulted
in
increased
phosphorylation
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
and
downstream
activation
of
MAP
kinases
.

Statistically

)
as
well
as
increased
expression
of
Bcl
-
xL
,
Bax
,
and
p53
in
metastatic
sites
compared
with
primary
tumors
could
indicate
an
association
of
these
proteins
with
oral
cancer
progression
and
development
of
metastases
.

Treatment
with
the
combination
of
1B3
and
DC101
in

mice
resulted
in

regression
in
58
%
of
mice
compared
to
that
in
18
%
of
mice
treated
with
DC101
alone
.

In
all
patients
,
a
major
and
consistent
induction
of
p53
target
genes
was
seen
.

Medical
therapy
to
improve
symptoms
,
stabilise
the
underlying
vascular
disease
and
improve
lower
limb
outcomes
is
an
important
and
effective
adjunct
to
lifestyle
modification
and
surgical
or
endovascular
interventions
in
patients
with

.

Modulating

Further
,
we
implemented
a
noninvasive

to
facilitate
the
assessment
of
the
metastatic

.

Taken
together
,
our
studies
,
based
on
a
molecular
imaging
approach
for
semiquantitative
detection
of
micrometastases
,
point
to
an
important
role
of
tumor

in
the

.

A
validated
assay
in
human

is
needed
to
study
the
role
of

The
response
to
taxol
and
heparin
-
steroid
was
similar
to
that
of
the
HPVAM
,
a
validated
angiogenesis
assay
.

Having
identified
the
nucleolar
localisation
sequence
in
BAG
-
1L
,
we
showed
that
mutation
of
this
sequence
did
not
prevent
BAG
-
1L
from
potentiating
VDR
activity
.

Furthermore
,
there
is
strong
evidence
suggesting
that
aberrant
activation
of
Wnt
signaling
induces
mammary
tumors
from
stem
/
progenitor
cells
,
and
that
Wnt
exerts
its
oncogenic
effects
through
LRP5

activation
of
beta

catenin
and

RESULTS
:

,
which
had

PURPOSE
:
Angiogenesis

have
strong
therapeutic
potential
as
antitumor

in

.

Treatment
involved

Mitogen
-

signaling
promotes
growth

.

Growth
inhibition
correlated
with
decreased
cellular
proliferation
and
extensive
necrosis
,
and
it
was
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
tumor
mean
vessel
density
as
well
as
a
reduction
in
serum
expression
of
angioproliferative
cytokines
.

These
results
are
consistent
with
our
initial
hypothesis
and
lead
us
to
propose
that
MKK
inhibition
by
LeTx
is
a
broadly
effective
strategy
for
targeting
neovascularization
in
fibrosarcomas
and
other
similar
proliferative
lesions
.

Finally
,
annexin

was
positively
associated
with
lymph

,
suggesting
that
it
may
be
a

factor
in

.

An
important
role
of
proprotein
convertases
in
tumorigenic
processes
has
been
suggested
by
various
studies

This
study
indicates
that
the
simultaneous
presence
of
ITC
and
VEGFR
-
1
expression
at
premetastatic
sites
is
clinically
significant
for
disease
progression
.

In
addition
,
ethanol

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
have
established
a
model
to
study
the
regulation
of
angiogenesis
by
human

.

A

was
carried

for
systematic

of
the

.

The
early

of
all

implies
that
the
rabbit

may
not
be
valid
for
chronic

.

Clinically

and
the
effect
was
elevated
in
young

.

The
heart

(

)
were
improved
more
significantly
in

was
inversely
correlated
to
the

The
semaphorin
7A
receptor
Plexin
C1
is
lost
during
melanoma
metastasis
.

The
transformation
of
normal
melanocytes
,
or
melanocyte
stem
cells
,
to
melanoma
,
is
a
complex
process
involving
multiple
mechanisms
.

Loss
of
tumor
suppressor
proteins
,
which
function
as
brakes
on
cell
growth
,
migration
,
or
cell
survival
,
was
recognized
early
on
as
an
important
mechanism
for
initiation
and
progression
of
melanoma
.

In
this
report
,
we
analyzed
the
expression
of
Plexin
C1
using
immunohistochemistry
on
sections
of
primary
and
matched
metastatic
lesions
from
19
subjects
and
in
a
large
melanoma
tumor
microarray
.

In
patients
with
pancreatic
carcinoma
,
the
levels
of
fibrinogen
in
the
group
with
jaundice
were
significantly
higher
than
in
patients
without
jaundice
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

The
group
with
lymphatic
metastasis
had
higher
levels
than
the
group
without
lymphatic
metastasis
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

The
elevated
fibrinogen
level
may
be
associated
with
invasiveness
and
lymphatic
metastasis
.

Therefore
,
genetic
instability
plays
an
important
role
in
inflammation
-
associated
cancers
.

Human
pituitary
tumor
transforming
gene
(
PTTG
)
overexpression
correlates
with
metastasis
in
multiple
tumors
,
and
yet
its
molecular
mechanisms
of
action
remain
elusive
.

We
detected
PTTG
overexpression
in
66
%
(
111
of
169
)
of
primary
esophageal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
ESCC
)
tumor
tissues
by
in

hybridization
.

Ectopic
PTTG
overexpression
in
a
representative
ESCC
cell
line
,
EC9706
,
increased
in
vitro
cell
migration
and
invasion
and
promoted
in
vivo
lymph

metastasis
.

By
using
mass

analysis
,
we
identified
that
PTTG
up
-
regulated
S100A4
and
galectin

and
down

of

media
.

Here
,
we
have
tested
endocytic
Rab
GTPases
for
regulation
of
VEGFR2
trafficking
and
signaling
linked
to
endothelial
cell
migration
.

We
recently
observed
that
FOXO3a
gene
inactivation
occurs
frequently
in
carcinogen
-
induced
lung
adenocarcinoma
(
LAC
)
.

Prior
to
this
cellular
outcome
,
FOXO3a
is
functionally
activated
and
mediates
a
large
-
scale
transcription
program
in
response
to
this
damage
involving
a
significant
modulation
of
440
genes
.

We
hypothesized
that
Erbb2
activation
contributes
to
UV
-
induced
skin
tumorigenesis
by
suppressing
cell
cycle
arrest
.

We
used
a
cellular
model
of
tumor
invasion
to
investigate
the
effect
of
activated
platelets
on
the
human
ovarian
cancer
cell
line
,
SKOV3
.

The
effect
of
platelets
on
the
content
of
urokinase
plasminogen
activator
(
uPA
)
and
VEGF
in
SKOV3
cell
conditioned
medium
was
measured
using
an
ELISA
assay
.

Exposure
to
platelets
resulted
in
significantly
increased
uPA
and
VEGF
content
of
SKOV3
cell
conditioned
medium
.

The
formation
of
new
blood
vessels
through
the
process
of
angiogenesis
is
critical
in
vascular
development
and
homeostasis
.

miR
-
378
,
miR
-
296
,
and
the
miR
-
17
-
92
cluster
contribute
to
tumor
angiogenesis
.

We
tested
this
possibility
with
in
vitro
assays
using
human
endothelial
cells
,
as
well
as
in
a
rodent
hindlimb
ischemia
model
.

Treatment
of
cultured
human
endothelial
cells
with
DAPT
,
a
gamma
secretase
inhibitor
,
increased
cell
migration
and
sprout
formation
in
response
to
VEGF
stimulation
with
a
biphasic
dependence
on
DAPT
concentration
.

Direct
intramuscular
or
intraperitoneal
injection
of
DAPT
did
not
result
in
the
same
level
of
improvement
,
suggesting
that
appropriate
presentation
of
DAPT
(
gel
delivery
)
is
important
for
its
activity
.

The
expression
of
SREBP
and
Cdc42
were
determined
by
Western

and

PCR
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
study
provides
new
candidate
genes
for
the
esophageal
cancer
microenvironment
.

However
,
the
exact
mechanisms
of
ARF
action
yet
remain
unclear
and
require
further
studies
by
different
specialists
at
both
the
molecular
genetic
and
other
levels
of
investigation
.

Inhibition
of

reduced
CBP

,
whereas
enforced
induction
of
p38
by

activators
(
e
.
g
.
MKK3
and
MKK6
)
enhanced
both
CBP
HAT
and
CCN1

activities
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
signal
-
controlled
activation
of
SRF
,
MRTF
-
A
,
and
CBP
provides
a
novel
connection
between
mechanical

as
in

treated
with
either
anti

antibody
or

.

Directed
EC
migration
is
a
central
step
in
this
process
and
depends
on
cellular
signaling
cascades
that
initiate
and
control
the

.

PURPOSE
:
Antiangiogenic
therapy
is
considered
as
an
effective
strategy
for
controlling
the
growth
and
metastasis
of
tumors
.

Angiogenesis
-
-
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
cancer
-
-
has
emerged
as
a
valid
therapeutic
target
in
oncology
.

It
is
interesting
that
certain
components
of
neutrophil
cytotoxic
arsenal
(
ROS
,
cytokines
,
specific
enzymes
)
participate
both
in
antitumoral
defenses
of
an
organism
and
protumoral
activity
.

The
aims
of
the
present
study
were
to
compare
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
the
antiangiogenic
and
antitumor
activities
of
metronomic
irinotecan
(
CPT
-
11
)
,
oxaliplatin
(
L
-
OHP
)
and
5
-
fluorouracil
(
5
-
FU
)
in
colorectal
cancer
and
to
investigate
the
metronomic
combination
of
these
drugs
.

HT
-
29
human
colorectal
cancer
xenograft
model
was
used
and
tumour
growth
,
microvessel
density
and
VEGF
quantification
were
performed
in
tumours
after
the
administration
of
metronomic
CPT
-
11
,
L
-
OHP
,
5
-
FU
and
their
simultaneous
combination
.

The
metronomic
concept
might
not
universally
apply
to
every
cytotoxic
drug
in
colorectal
cancer
and
metronomic
combination
regimens
should
be
used
with
caution
.

Notably
,
a
similar
vascular
phenotype
was
induced
by
morpholino
-
mediated
knockdown
of
the
integrin
alpha2
subunit
.

TNF
-
alpha
is
also
an
essential
component
of
the
immune
system
and
is
required
for
hematopoiesis
,
for
protection
from
bacterial
infection
and
for
immune
cell
-
mediated
cytotoxicity
.

accounting
for
a
large

.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
doxorubicin
in
Hct
-
116
human
colon
carcinoma
cells
in
order
to
clarify
if
a
time
/

range
for
optimal
doxorubicin
-
induced
apoptosis
exists
.

In
contrast
,
continuous
(
24h
)
treatment
with
doxorubicin
reduced
the
number
of
living
cells
with
no
parallel
raise
in
the
amount
of
dead
cells
.

In
addition
,
the
results
of
the
previously
tested
transketolase
like
1
protein
(
TKTL1
)
expression
were
correlated
to
LDH5
expression
.

No
significant
correlation
could
be
detected
with
regard
to
TNM
-
stage
,
grading
or
survival
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
LDH5
is
overexpressed
in
NSCLC
and
could
hence
serve
as
an
additional
marker
for
malignancy
.

Unlike
the
majority
of
somatic
cells
,
in
which

are
generally
silent
,
normal
lymphocytes
show
transient
physiological
hTERT
expression
and
telomerase
activity
according
to
their
differentiation
/
activation
status
.

These
models
may
have
clinically
relevant
implications
,
particularly
for
the
tailoring
of
therapeutic
strategies
targeting

we
found
that

Our

suggest
that

CONCLUSION
:
The

in

suggests
cross

that
may
be
of
importance
in
the
modulation
of

.

The
eph
gene
encodes
a
putative
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
for
an
as
yet
unknown
ligand
.

We
show
here
that
NIH3T3

acquire
tumorigenic
ability
in

and
make

of
the

gene
to
a
high
level
.

It
is
concluded
that
the
observed
increase
in
the
Na
+
/
K
+
ratio
in
ascites
tumor
cells
is
connected
with
their
enhanced
ability
to
synthesize
lactic
acid
.

Immunohistochemical
study
with
specific
antisera
was
done
.

Quercetin
increased
the

The

and
are
candidates
for

.

Differences
in
polyphosphoinositide
metabolism
have
been
reported
for

.

In
extracts
of
growing
and
stationary
Swiss
3T3
cells
,
the
total

of

activity
was
similar
,
indicating
that

does
not
alter
the
level
of

in

to

as
expected
for
the

Ha
-
ras
gene
present
in
the
donor
DNA
.

As
chicken
embryo
fibroblasts
are
devoid
of
EGF
receptors
,
their
activity
is
not
potentiated
by
EGF
.

Experiments
using
the

of
the
SV

A

have
demonstrated
that
the
SV

large
T
-
antigen
is
strictly
required
both
for
immortalization
and
induction
anchorage
independence
of
cells
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
immortalized
phenotype
is
mediated
by
an
extra
cellular
factor
.

The
increased
transport
rate
is
a
consequence
of
an
increased
number
of
transporters
in
the
transformed
cells
.

After
48
h
in
culture
,
DR
antigen
expression
was
substantially
increased
,
but
no
significant
changes
were
observed
in
methylation
of
the
DR
alpha
locus
or
in
the
amount
of
DR
mRNA
which
was
present
.

This
suggests
that
expression
of
DR
antigens
also
can
be
modulated
post
-
transcriptionally
.

The
increased
energy
expended
by
the
host
to
synthesize
substrate
,
which
is
utilized
by
the
tumor
,
is
a
potential
cause
of
cancer
cachexia
.

In
these
transformants
,
mitogen
depletion
elicited
an
increase
in
the
Rb
level
comparable
to
that
in

cells
;
wt
SVLT
,
however
,
promoted
the
phosphorylation
of
a
large
part
of
the
induced
Rb
.

The
region
of
the
LTR
identified
here
as
being
important
in
trans
activation
has
recently
been
shown
to
be
a
critical
determinant
of
the
leukemogenicity
and
latency
of
Moloney
murine
leukemia
virus
.

Histologically
,
both
2G7
-
treated
and
control
tumors
were
identical
.

Cytokines
and
growth
factors
induce
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
(
STATs
)
that
directly
activate
gene
expression
.

Induction
of
this
DNA
-
binding
activity
was
accompanied
by
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
Stat3
and
correlated
with
Src
transformation
.

Furthermore
,
the
conditioned
medium
from
these
cells
enhanced
vascular
permeability
in
vivo
.

Two
weeks
after

,
there
was
histological
evidence
of
neovascularization
in
the
tissues
surrounding

,
whereas
no
significant

.

Furthermore
,

demonstrated

higher
than
the

with

.

.

MPs
also
play
a
role
in
tumor
angiogenesis
.

Several
reports
have
indicated
that
tetracyclines
can
suppress
tumor
MPs
as
well
.

The
principal
types
of
tumors
were
plasmacytomas
secreting

novel

that
expressed

such
as
Sca

CD4
,
Thy

CD34
and
CD45
(
B220
)
,
consistent
with
an
origin
very
early
in
B

lymphoid
development
.

Rearrangement
of
the
c

myc
gene
was
common
in
the
plasmacytomas
,
implying
a
synergistic
role
for
myc
and

in

,
but
was
not

Tumorigenic

We
have
identified
several
mechanisms
by
which
the
angiogenic

vascular
permeability
factor
/
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VPF
/
VEGF
)
likely
regulates
endothelial
cells
(
EC
)
migration
.

VPF
/
VEGF
induced
dermal
microvascular
EC
expression
of
mRNAs
encoding
the
alphav
and
beta3
integrin
subunits
resulting
in
increased
levels
of
the
alphavbeta3
heterodimer
at
the
cell
surface
,
and
VPF
/
VEGF
also
induced
mRNA
encoding
osteopontin
(
OPN
)
,
an
alphavbeta3
ligand
.

Furthermore
,
in
comparison
with
native
OPN
,
thrombin
-
cleaved
OPN
stimulated
a
greater
rate
of
EC
migration
in

,
which
was
additive
to
the
increased
migration
associated
with
induction
of
alpha

.

Disease

DFS
)
and

were
estimated
by
the
Kaplan

method
.

The
fact
that
viral
or
other
adjunctive
vectors
were
not
required
further
suggests
that
secreted
gene
products
may
have
potential
therapeutic
utility
even
when
the
number
of
successfully
transfected
cells
remains
low
.

In
the
current
report
,
we
tested
the
sensitivity
of
the
c

myc
-
overexpressing
cells
(
Rat

/
c

myc
)
to
two
additional
chemicals
:
5
-
azacytidine
and
MnSO4
.

These
chemicals
differ
from
the
direct
-
acting
mutagens
tested
previously
.

It
has
been
shown
previously
that
the
55
-
kDa
polypeptide
abrogates
p53
-
mediated
transactivation
and
that
mutants
defective
in
p53
binding
are
unable
to
cooperate
with
E1A
in
transformation
.

We
demonstrate
directly
that
the
wild
-
type
55
-
kDa
protein
is
able
to
block
E1A
-
induced
p53
-
dependent
apoptosis
,
whereas
cells
infected
by
mutant
pm490
/

/
5A
,
which
contains
alanine
residues
at
all
three
phosphorylation
sites
,
exhibited
extensive
DNA
fragmentation
and
classic
apoptotic
cell
death
.

The
E1B
-
55kDa
product
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
intrinsic
transcriptional
repression
activity
when
localized
to
promoters
,
such
as
by
fusion
with
the
GAL4
DNA
-
binding
domain
,
even
in
the
absence
of
p53
.

(
aged

years
)
who
had
undergone
prophylactic
thyroidectomy
since
1990
were
included
in
the
study
.

A
long

was
produced
and
an
immortalized
subclone
,
RSVT2

,
was
further
derived
under
a
forced
crisis
regimen
.

Since
both
cell
lines
remained
non

tumorigenic
in
nude
mice
,
these
properties
indicate
that
they
attained
a
premalignant
phenotype
.

Interestingly
,
under
normal
conditions
muscle

express
only
a

.

Induced

of
these

has
been
used
to
demonstrate

on
some
aspects
of

in

.

This
resulted
in
formation
of

,
which
were

.

In

.

In

,
tyrosinase

expressed
and

.

These
were

in

,
the

Using

,
we
showed
that
Crk
was

.

The
necessity
of
Crk
in

was
shown
both
by
the
overexpression
of
dominant

and
by
the

The

of

completely
inhibited
ephrin

.

These

indicated
that

plays
a
critical

.

However
,
we
need
to
determine
whether
it
happens
in
breast

.

METHODS
:
The
expression
of
DCC
and
netrin
-

in
normal
endometrial
glands
and
in
cancer
cell
lines
was
examined
by
RT

PCR
and
immunohistochemistry
.

In
addition
,
all
of
the
endometrial
cancer
cell
lines
lost
normal
DCC
expression
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
MDM2
oncoprotein
promotes
p53
degradation
via
ubiquitin
,
establishing
negative
feedback
control
of
p53
and
consequently
affecting
cell
cycle
arrest
and
apoptosis
.

Cox
proportional
hazards
multivariate
analysis
(
MVA
)
was
used
to
determine
the
relation
of
MDM2
to
the
endpoints
.

The
ACIS
index
,
using
a
cutoff
point
defined
by
the
median
value
,
<
or
=
3
%
versus

,
was
related
to

;

)
and
MVA
(

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
MDM2
expression
quantified
by
image
analysis
was
weakly
associated
with
DM
.

The
present
study
was
therefore
designed
to
evaluate
the
expression
of
thrombospondin

and

(

)
,

Bovine
papillomavirus
E7
transformation
function
correlates
with
cellular
p600
protein
binding
.

The
E7
oncoprotein
of
bovine
papillomavirus
type
1
(
BPV
-
1
)
is
required
for
the
full
transformation
activity
of
the
virus
.

To
address
this
question
,
we
used
the
proteomic
approach
of
tandem
affinity
purification
to
identify
cellular
proteins
that
are
in
complex
with
E7
,
and
identified
the
600
-
kDa
protein
,
p600
,
as
a
binding
partner
of
E7
.

Additionally
,
knockdown
of
p600
reduced
transformation
of
cells
expressing
both
BPV
-
1
E6
and
E7
,
as
well
as
E6
alone
,
suggesting
that
the
ability
of
E7
to
transformed
cells
is
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
through
its
ability
to
bind
p600
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
the
existence
of
endothelial
precursors
in
adult
bone
marrow
cells
,
but
it
is
unclear
whether
those
precursors
have
a
role
in
tumor
neovascularization
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
VEGF
-
A
stimulation
of
hemopoietic
cells
does
not
significantly
alter
this
process
.

Estimation
of
lectin
binding
site
and
pattern
was
useful
to
evaluate
the
malignant
potential
of
cell
proliferation
.

In
conclusion
,
the
decrease
in
c
-
Myc
expression
enhanced
the
VLB
sensitivity
,
triggering
earlier
apoptosis
through
induction
of
the
intrinsic
pathway
.

Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that

We
conclude
that

of
a

Vascular
endothelial

(

)
is
one
of
the
most
critical
factors
that
induce
angiogenesis
and
has
thus
become
an

target
for
antiangiogenesis
treatment
.

However
,
most
current
anti

VEGF
agents
often
cause
some
side
effects
when

.

We
have
previously
shown
that
IFI16
is
required
for
proinflammatory
gene
stimulation
by
IFN

gamma
through

To

induction
might
be
extended
to
other
proinflammatory
cytokines
such
as
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-
alpha
,
we
used
the
strategy
of
the
RNA

to
knock
down
IFI16

,
and
analyze
the

of

In

we
have

to
acutely
reduce

by
regulating

of

However
,
these

.

Vascular
endothelial

is
the
crucial
step
for
initiating

that
lead
to

.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
D2

(
D2DR
)
colocalizes
with
VEGFR

at

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of

(

on

In

was
induced
by

and
they
received

.

In
this
study
we
separated
weakly
acidic
phenolic
components
from
other
neutral
,
acidic
and
basic
components
of
tobacco
smoke
condensate
(
TSC
)
and
observed
that
phenolic
fraction
of
TSC
significantly
increased
the
number
of
colonies
of
promotion

JB6

cells
that
showed
anchorage

on
soft

in
response
to
BPDE
(
an
ultimate

produced
by
metabolic
activation
of
the
PAH

)
.

Several
regulatory
and
signaling
molecules
governing
angiogenesis
are
of
interest
,
including
growth
factors
(
eg
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
,
platelet
-
derived
growth

,
fibroblast
growth

,
and
epidermal
growth

)
,
receptor
tyrosine

,
and
transcription
factors
such
as
hypoxia
inducible
factor
,
as
well
as
molecules
involved
in
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
and
phosphoinositide
3

kinase
(
PI3K
)
signaling
.

Overexpression
of
Bax

Although
many
studies
have
been
carried
out
to
investigate
the
chemopreventive
role
of
flavonoids
,
less
attention
has
been
focused
on
phenolic
acids
.

It
is
possible
that
the
suppressive
effect
of
GA
on
MMP

/

might
involve
the
inhibition
of
NF
-
kappaB
activity
.

The
lack
of
treatment
for
worried

well
patients
with
high
-
grade
prostatic
intraepithelial
neoplasia
combined
with
issues
of
recurrence
and
hormone
resistance
in
prostate
cancer
survivors
remains
a
major
public
health
obstacle
.

p
-
XSC
effectively
inhibits
AR
expression
and

in
both

.

p

XSC
also
decreases
Akt
phosphorylation
as
well
as
Akt
-
specific
phosphorylation
of
the
AR
.

Our
data
suggest
that
p
-
XSC
inhibits
multiple
signaling
pathways
in
prostate
cancer
,
likely
accounting
for
the
downstream
effects
on
proliferation
and
apoptosis
.

Incubation

for
4

while
incubation
with

killed
almost
100
%
of
both

within
24h
.

This
treatment
also
changed
the

in
both
MG

Our
earlier
studies
showed
that
DATS
induced
apoptosis
in
human
colon
cancer
HT29
and
colo
205
cell
lines
in

.

In
vitro
studies
,
the
results
indicated
that
DATS
induced
morphological
changes
and
induction
of
apoptosis
in
CT26
cells
.

In
vivo
studies
,
CT26
cancer
cells
were
implanted
into
BALB

c
mice
and
groups
of
mice
were
treated
with
vehicle
,
DATS
(
10
and
50
mg
/
kg
of
body
weight
)
.

Treatment
with
vehicle
or
with
10
and
50
mg
/
kg
of
DATS
resulted
in
a
reduction
in
tumor
volume
and
weight
.

Thus
,
such
a
resonating
cross
-
talk
can
amplify
Hedgehog
signaling
,
resulting
in
molecular
chatter
that
overall
promotes
tumor
progression
.

We
examined
the
paired

of
86

patients
for
the
occurrence
of

The
overall

of
the

of
the

among

cases
was

Aglycon

induces
apoptosis
via
activation
of

.

Rhizochalin
is
a
two

compound
isolated
from
the
sponge
Rhizochalina

.

However
,
the
molecular

CK1delta
mutants
exhibited
a
reduced

compared
to

in

.

Two
of
them
were
selected
for
high
or
low
osteonectin
expression
and
tested
in
vivo
in
spontaneous
and
artificial
metastasis
assays
.

High
osteonectin
expression
was
correlated
with
high
lung
colonization
.

When
10
(

were
injected
i

,
median

in

respectively
(
p
less
than

)
.

We
found
that
the
severity
of
vascular
abnormalities
correlated
positively
with
the
severity
of
histologic
epithelial
lesions
;
this
finding
is
consistent
with
colposcopic

As
reported
previously
(
Namba

,
normal
human
fibroblasts
were
transformed
into
immortal

with
abnormal

by
Co

gamma

ray
irradiation
.

The
tumors
were
also
serially
transplantable
into
other
mice
.

These
activities
provide
an
explanation
for
the
angiogenic
properties
of
EGF
in
vivo
.

It
is
also
clear
that
diffusible
angiogenic
stimuli
can
be
released
not
only
from
most
solid
tumors
,
but
also
from
at
least
three
non

neoplastic
cells
.

Under
specific
conditions
,

could
be
used
as
an
exogenous

as
well

whereas
a

was
not
phosphorylated
in

.

Some
potentially
promising
prognostic
,

,
and
therapeutic
modalities
for

are
also
discussed
.

H4IIEC3

were
investigated
as

and
as

.

Comparison
between

of
viral

of
non

revealed
high

similarities
in

,
which
were

.

The
detection
of
increased

,
and
the
application
of

are
currently
being
investigated
.

Two
of
the
mutations
included
a
G
to
C
substitution
at
codon
12
,
and
a
G
to
A
substitution
at

,
resulting
in
a
glycine
to
arginine
,
and
an
alanine
to
threonine
change
at
these
amino
acids
,
respectively
.

Rat
tissues
known
to
express
these
glucose
transporters
were
used
as
controls
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Higher
expression
of
the

by
breast
cancer
cells
compared
with
the
healthy

High

of
somatostatin
receptors
in

tissue
:
role
in

interaction
?

In
colonic
carcinoma
specimens
,
the
peritumoral
vessels
expressed
a
high
density
of
somatostatin
receptors
,
whereas
the
neoplastic
tissue
itself
was
receptor
-
negative
in
many
cases
.

In
all
cases
,
the
somatostatin
receptors
were
localized
in
veins
,
particularly
in
the
smooth
-
muscle
cell
layer
.

Levels
of
uPA

-
plasminogen
activator
receptor
(
uPAR
)
and
plasminogen

)
were
measured
semiquantitatively
in
paraffin
sections
of
tumours
from
147
patients
with
NSCLC
.

There
was
a
significant
positive
relationship
between
PAI

levels
and
T

(
p

)
in

However
,
the
role
of
the

alterations
in

remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
proto

myc
promoter
was
down

regulated
by
WT1
in
transient

assays
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
incidence
of
BRCA1
promoter
region
methylation
in
tumours
in
which
loss
of
BRCA1
has
been
shown
to
play
a
role
in
pathogenesis
(
breast
and
ovarian
carcinomas
)
with
the
incidence
in
tumours
in
which
BRCA1
is
unlikely
to
play
a
role
in
pathogenesis
.

Promoter
region
hypermethylation
was
significantly
more
common
(
P

.
008
)
in
breast
and
ovarian
cancer
(
6
/
38
tumours
methylated
)
than
in
colon
cancer
(
0
/
35
tumours
methylated
)
or
in
leukaemias
(
0
/
19
samples
methylated
)
.

We
have
constructed
a
recombinant
adenovirus
that
expresses
murine
endostatin
that
is
biologically
active
both
in

,
as
determined
in
endothelial
cell
proliferation
assays
,
and
in
vivo
,
by
suppression
of
angiogenesis
induced
by
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
165
.

Hypermethylation
of
final
sigma
is
functionally
important
,
because
treatment
of

-
non
-
expressing
breast
cancer
cell
lines
with
the
drug
5
-
aza
-
2
'
-
deoxycytidine
resulted
in
demethylation
of
the
gene
and
synthesis
of
final
sigma
mRNA
.

Western

expression
of
the

,
proteins
previously
shown
to

A
summary
is
made
of
recent
advances
in
the
understanding
of
IL
-
18
structure
,
processing
,
receptor
expression
and
immunoregulatory
functions
.

In
this
work
,
we
show
that
an
11
-
amino
acid
peptide
derived
from
the
second
immunoglobulin
-
like
domain
of
Flt
-
1
functions
as
an
angiogenic
inhibitor
in
chick
chorioallantoic
membrane
and
inhibited
VEGF
-
induced
vascular
permeability
in
Miles
'
assay
without
binding
to
VEGF
directly
.

The
two
parameters
were
more
frequently
observed
in
the
SCC
with
VEGF
/
p53
coexpression
than
in
those
without
the
coexpression
.

Furthermore
,
both
PLD1
and
PLD2
transformants
,
but
not
vector
-
transfectants
,
induced
undifferentiated
sarcoma
when
transplanted
into
nude
mice
.

Both
PLD1
-
and
PLD2
-
mediated
cell
cycle
distributions
in
stable
cell
lines
revealed
an
increased
fraction
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
compared
with
control
cells
.

In
the
current
article
we
demonstrate
that
TnI
inhibits
both
bFGF
-
stimulated
and
basal
levels
of
endothelial
cell
proliferation
,
and
we
hypothesize
that
this
inhibition
is
occurring
,
at
least
in
part
,
via
an
interaction
of
TnI
with
the
cell
-
surface
bFGF
receptor
on
capillary
endothelial
cells
.

Highly

.

The
mechanism
underlying
the
association
between
high
PE
and
poor
clinical
outcome
is
unclear
,
although
it
may
be
related
to
the
possible
PE
reflection
of
tumor

.

In
this
report
we
studied
the
effects
of
SFLLR
,
an
agonist
of
the
activated
thrombin
receptor
and
thrombin
receptor
peptide
and
non
peptide
antagonists
on
angiogenesis
in
the
chick
chorioallantoic
membrane
(
CAM
)
system
.

RESULTS
:
Abnormal
E
-
cadherin
and
beta
-
catenin
staining
correlated
with
depth
of
tumour
invasion
in
differentiated
-
type
tumours
.

Multivariate
analysis
revealed
abnormal
E
-
cadherin
expression
as
an
independent
factor
that
correlated
with
submucosal
invasion
in
early
gastric
cancer
.

Furthermore
,
the
formation
of
complexes
containing
KDR
and
NRP1
markedly
increased
125I

VEGF165
binding
to
KDR
.

Invasive
carcinomas
without
spiculated
margins
are
poorly
differentiated
tumors
.

Mammographic
patterns
of
microcalcifications
depend
on
their
physiopathological
process
(

)
,
and
the
shape
of

)
typifies
their

of
origin
(

Knowledge
of
radiopathological
correlations
in
breast
diseases
helps
the
radiologists
to
analyze
and
characterize
breast

.

Notably
,
three
immortalizing
E6
mutants
that
do
not
induce
direct
p53
degradation
but
do
interact
with
hADA3
induced
the
abrogation
of

transactivation
and
G

cell
cycle
arrest
after
DNA

,
comparable
to

.

Ultimately
,
the
primary

was
established
on
clinical
and

grounds
in
71
cases
(

.

In

.

RESULTS
:
The

showed
the

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Fluconazole
plus
adjunct
high

prednisolone
treatment
was
most
effective
when
administered
9
days
after

.

Gross

.

There
was
no
difference
in

Both
polyester

(
PF

)
have
better
tissue
integration
than
the
PP

,
as
evidenced
by
the
higher

Swift
elimination
of

is
an
important

The

induction
of
apoptosis
in
cancerous
cells
and
in
antiviral
immune
responses
,
respectively
,
but
little
is
known
about
their
interrelationship
.

Furthermore
,

by
subcutaneous
injection

an
Alzet

of
a
potent

,
gave
a
partial

but
statistically
significant

)
reduction
in

of

231
in
SCID
mice
,
even
though
no
attempt
was
made
to
inhibit
other
important
targets
such
as
CCR7
.

These
angiogenic
activities
are
neutralized
by
a
specific
antibody
against
CCL16
.

The
largely
restricted
CCL16
expression
in
the
liver
suggests
that
this
chemokine
may
play
a
role
in
hepatic
vascular
formation
during
development
and
in
angiogenesis
associated
to
hepatic
diseases
.

Despite
several
advances
in
therapeutic
options
,
the
disease
remains
incurable
.

Constitutively
increased
c

kinase
activity
reconstituted
the
increases
in

and

PA
observed
with
angiotensin

interruption
.

Loss

of

function
effects
were
also
observed
in
HIF
-
1alpha
-
null
embryonic
stem
cells
.

However
,
the
expression
level
of
E
-
cadherin
had
an
inverse
relationship
with
both
differentiation
level
of
the
tumor
and
lymphatic

invasion
(

and

,
respectively
)
.

RESULTS
:

were
detected
on

.

In
addition
,
PPARgamma
protein
was
not
detected
in
all
of
the
eight
carcinomas
in
which
COX
-
2
protein
was
detected
,
suggesting
that
expression
of
PPARgamma
and
COX

was
in
a
reciprocal
relationship
.

Osteopontin
(
OPN
)
is
a
secreted
adhesive
glycophosphoprotein
expressed
by
several
cell
types
.

It
is
normally
produced
in
bone
,
teeth
,
kidney
and
epithelial
lining
tissues
and
is
found
in
plasma
and
breast
milk
.

Here
we
show
that
GR
activation
leads
to
both
the
rapid
induction
of
MAPK
phosphatase
-
1
(
MKP
-
1
)
mRNA
and
its
sustained
expression
.

It
is
therefore
highly
likely
that
these
alterations
are
an
important
component
in
tumor
resistance
to
therapy
.

Recent
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
evidence
suggest
that
they
may
also
have
direct
antitumor
effects
via
induction
of
apoptosis
,
inhibition
of
the
invasive
potential
of
tumor
cell
lines
in
vitro
,
inhibition
of
angiogenesis
,
and
reduction
in
tumor
growth
indirectly
via
effects
on
accessory
cells
.

This
is
a
randomized
,
open
label
,
prospective
study
that
examined
the
effect
of
preventive
zoledronic
acid
treatment
on
the
development
of
bone
metastases
in
patients
with
recurrent
solid
tumors
,
without
bone
metastases
at
the
time
of
randomization
.

HYPOTHESIS
:
This
study
was
designed
to
compare
coronary
collateral
circulation
(
CCC
)
in
patients
with
proliferative
diabetic
retinopathy
(
PDR
)
with
that
in
patients
without
DR
.

Groups
1
and
2
consisted
of
48
patients
without
DR
and
42
patients
with
PDR
,
respectively
.

We
also
show
that
VEGFR1
+
cells
express
VLA
-
4
(
also
known
as
integrin
alpha4beta1
)
,
and
that
tumour
-
specific
growth
factors
upregulate
fibronectin
-
-
a
VLA
-
4
ligand
-
-
in
resident
fibroblasts
,
providing
a
permissive
niche
for
incoming
tumour
cells
.

To
this
end
,
we
generated
endothelial
cell
lines
stably
expressing
vGPCR
or
key
KSHV
latently
expressed
proteins
(
vCyclin
,
vFlip
,
and

)
.

Here
,
HGF
stimulation
of
melanocytes
was
seen
to
up

regulate
c
-
Met
expression
.

Finally
,
dominant
-
negative
inhibition
of
Mitf
resulted
in
profound
resistance
of
melanocytes
and
melanoma
cells
to
HGF
-
dependent
matrix
invasion
,
suggesting
a
physiologic
role
for
this
pathway
in
melanocytic
development
and
melanoma
.

The
development
of
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
presumably
occurs
in
multiple
steps
and
is
influenced
by
numerous
factors
.

In
the
present
study
a
DNA
probe
derived
from
cellular
DNA
sequences
adjacent
to
the
previously
characterized
HBV
insert
was
used
to
analyze
a
set
of
19
matched
normal
liver
and
HBV

positive
hepatoma
samples
obtained
from
the
same
region
of
China
,
near
Shanghai
.

Tumor

specific
DNA
changes
were
detected
in
two
additional
HCCs
,
suggesting
that
the
small
region
of
chromosome
17p
defined
by
the
flanking
cell
DNA
probe
is
commonly
altered
in
hepatomas
.

Here
we
show
that
angiogenesis
is
severely
impaired
in
PSMA
-
null
animals
and
that
this
angiogenic
defect
occurs
at
the
level
of
endothelial
cell
invasion
through
the
extracellular

Together
,
these
results
suggest
that
Tip30
is
an
intrinsic
and
negative
regulator
of
MEC
proliferation
partly
through
the
inhibition
of
Wisp2
and
Igf

,
and
its
absence
in
the
mammary

may
predispose
MECs

This
work
is
again
extremely
significant
for

as
Dvorak

is
leading
his
colleagues
all
over
the
world
to
examine
how
to
treat
a

.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
The
tissues
were
stained
with
monoclonal

and
Ki

.

The
results
were

PURPOSE
:
The
staging
of
colorectal
cancer
,
therapeutic
decision
making
in
the
management
of
early
and
advanced
colorectal
cancer
,
and
dilemmas
posed

are
discussed
.

The
optimal
duration
of
chemotherapy
in
patients
with
early
and
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
is
unclear
.

However
,
the
role
of
IL
-

in
non

Hodgkin
'
s
lymphoma
(
NHL
)
has
not
been
fully
determined
.

This

indicated
that

might
be
useful
as
a
diagnostic
marker
of

.

This
chapter
provides
a
new
intravital
microscopic
method
for
detecting
and
measuring
NO
-
dependent
angiogenesis
in
a
mouse
model
.

Diabetic
mice
,
which
typically
show
impaired
postischemic
muscular
neovascularization
and
blood
perfusion
recovery
,
have
these
defects
corrected
by
intramuscular
gene
transfer
of
a
dominant
negative
mutant
form
of
p75
(
NTR
)
.

Collectively
,
our
data
newly
demonstrate
the
antiangiogenic
action
of
p75
(
NTR
)
and
open
new
avenues
for
the
therapeutic
use
of
p75
(
NTR
)

to
combat
diabetes
-
induced
microvascular
liabilities
.

RESULTS
:
The
cRGD
-
HL
significantly
inhibited
adhesion
and
migration
of
endothelial
cells
to
vitronectin
,
and
tubular
structures
of
endothelial
cells
.

It
was
thought
that
potent
antiangiogenic
effect
of
cRGD
-
HL
was
probably
due
to
the
interference
of
alpha
(
v
)
beta
(
3
)
-
mediated
interaction
,
resulting
in
the
enhanced
antitumoral
activity
against
SCC7
tumor
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
demonstrated
that
cRGD
-
modified
heparin
derivative
enhanced
anti
-
angiotherapeutic
effects
against
solid
tumor
,
and
therefore
,
it
could
be
applied
to
treat
various
cancers
and
angiogenic
diseases
as
a
potent
angiogenesis
inhibitor
.

The
mice
were
treated
by
intratumoral
injection
of

Ad
-
mEndostatin
.

It
is
concluded
that
its
action
is
targeted
to
tumor
neovasculature
and
the
mechanism
is
inhibition
of
tumor
angiogenesis
.

During
normal
skin
function
,
p53
in
the
keratinocyte
is
a
transducer
of
the
skin
tanning
signal
and
an
essential
component
of
what
is
effectively
a
keratinocyte
-
melanocyte
signaling
cycle
that
regulates
skin
pigmentation
.

In
this
review
,
we
outline
the
known
mechanisms
that
impair
p53
itself
and
its
immediate
regulators
or
target
genes
during
melanomagenesis
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
management
of
hormone
-
refractory
prostate
cancer
(
HRPC
)
still
remains
as
an
important
challenge
of
daily
oncology
practice
.

All
-
trans
retinoic
acid
(
ATRA
)
could
potently
inhibit
the
growth
of
prostate
cancer
cells
in
vitro
and
its
combination
with
various
anticancer
agents
results
in
increased
cytotoxicity
.

METHODS
:
XTT
cell
proliferation
assay
was
used
for
showing
cytotoxicity
.

Its
control
of
growth
factor
signaling
usually
involves
interactions
with
the
heparan
sulfate
chains
covalently
coupled
to
the
protein
core
'
s
N
-
terminus
.

The
patient
received
a
prescription
for
100
mg
Ultralan
to
be
taken
daily
for
3
days
and
then
tapered
in
3
day
steps
.

Robo4

.

However
,
MKN

,
MKN

45
,
MKN
-

,
and
SNU16
cells
did
not
express
membrane
CXCR4
.

There
is
accumulating
evidence
that
the
tissue
damage
associated
with
chronic
wounds
is
initiated
and
propagated
by
an
inappropriately
excessive
inflammatory
response
.

In
vitro
studies
also
suggest
progesterone
may
play
a
role
in
modulating
inflammation
.

Macrophages
are
essential
mediators
of
inflammation
and
wound
healing
.

Macrophages
can
be
activated
in
a
classical
or
alternative
manner
in
parallel
with
the

Here
,
we
established
lymph

models
by
injecting
overexpressing

-
D
Lewis
lung

cells
into
C57BL
/
6
mice
to
explore
the
effect
of
honokiol
on
tumor
-
associated
lymphangiogenesis
and
related
lymph
node
metastasis
.

The
present
findings
may
be
of
importance
to
investigate
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
spread
of
cancer
via
the
lymphatics
and
explore
the
therapeutical
strategy
of
honokiol
on
antilymphangiogenesis
and
antimetastasis
.

The
selected
peptide
was
tested
for
the
antitumor
activity
against
mildly
aggressive
xenografted
prostate
carcinoma
and
highly
aggressive
renal
cell
carcinoma
.

To
verify
that
P18
acts
in
the
same
manner
as
PEDF
,
we
used
immunohistochemistry
to
measure
PEDF
targets
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor
2
,
and
CD95
ligand
expression
in
P18
-
treated
vasculature
.

RESULTS
:
P14
and
P18
blocked
endothelial
cell
chemotaxis
;
P18
and
P23
induced
apoptosis
.

Finally
,
CD47
signaling
may
suppress
angiogenesis
because
4N1K
significantly
inhibited
endothelial
cell
migration
and
tube
formation
in
vitro
.

Cisplatin
reduces
endothelial
cell
migration

activity
.

Expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene
(
ePTFE
)
vascular
grafts
were
coated
with
perlecan
and
tested
in
an
ovine
carotid
interposition
model
for
a
period
of
6
weeks
and
assessed
using
light
and
scanning
microscopy
.

A
putative
progestin
-
response
element
was
identified
in
the
human
TSP
-
1
promoter
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
a
progestin
-
PR
complex
might
directly
regulate
transcription
of
the
TSP
-
1
gene
in
human
cells
.

Metastasis
from
lung
adenocarcinoma
can
occur
swiftly
to
multiple
organs
within
months
of
diagnosis
.

Insufficient
angiogenesis
occurs
in
diseases
such
as
coronary
artery
disease
,
stroke
and
chronic
wounds
.

Using
a
human
recombinant
antibody
(
scFv
)
specific
for
the
angiogenesis
marker
domain
B
of
fibronectin
,
interleukin
2
,
and
an
scFv
able
to
neutralize
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
,
we
expressed
various
biologically
active
uteroglobin
fusion
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
compared
with
similar
fusion
proteins
in
which
uteroglobin
was
not
used
,
the
use
of
uteroglobin
improved
properties
of
solubility
and
stability
.

Ecotropic

(

)
is
a
nuclear

factor
,
which
is
essential
for
the
proliferation
/
maintenance
of
hematopoietic
stem
cells
(
HSCs
)
.

In
particular
,
the
activity
of
angiogenic
factors
is
crucial
for
tumor
progression
.

To
examine
this
hypothesis
,
we
used
NCI
-
H1299
non

small

lung
cancer
(

constructed
an
ICAM

-
over
-
expressing
stable

,
which
exhibited
increased
cell
migration
and
invasion
.

Taken
together
,
our
findings
suggest
that

stimulates
cancer

via
ICAM
-
3
/
Akt
/

/

pathway
regardless
of

,
and
this
reflects
the
possibility
that
ICAM

could
be
considered
as
a
candidate
for
anti

drug
development
and
as
a

that
there
is

Pouch

Prior

then
declined

Transformation

Now
,
by

experiments
with
a

we
show
that
the

expressed
on

is
a

of
at

three

The

,
were
examined
in
a

we
developed
to
approximate
the

of

.

Similar

in
NME
protein
levels
were
observed
in
tumors
induced
by
the
two

in
nude

The

demonstrated
that

the

unchanged
in
the

when
compared

Twenty

Such

may
be
considered
either
examples
of
a

or
as

In

It
is
thought
that
radiation
treatment
inhibits
neovascularization
of

and
this
may
account

for
abnormalities

.

Thus
,
TNF

is
based
on

that
the

These

demonstrate
that

by
interfering
with
a

and
that
is
specifically
involved
in
the

of

.

Via
yeast

,
we
found
that
A20
binds
to
a
novel
protein
,
ABIN
,
which
mimics
the
NF

kappaB
inhibiting
effects
of
A20
upon

,
suggesting
that
the
effect
of
A20
is
mediated
by
its

with
this

ABIN
.

prevents

The

We

that

These

We

and
its

In

,
the

Cdc14
,
a

regulator
of
exit
from

,
is
released
from
its
inhibitor
Cfi1
/
Net1
in
the
nucleolus
during
anaphase
.

A
signaling
cascade
,
known
as
the
mitotic
exit
network
(
MEN
)
,
controls
this
release
.

We
also
show
that
the
FEAR
network
initiates
Cdc14
release
from
Cfi1

Net1
during
early
anaphase
,
and
MEN
maintains
Cdc14

It
is
now
clear
that
HSP
can
and
do
exit
mammalian
cells
,
interact
with
cells
of
the
immune

,
and
exert
immunoregulatory

Recent
studies
of
histone
methylation
have
yielded
fundamental
new
insights
pertaining
to
the
role
of
this
modification
in
gene
activation
as
well
as
in
gene
silencing
.

While
a
number
of
methylation
sites
are
known
to
occur
on
histones
,
only
limited
information
exists
regarding
the
relevant
enzymes
that
mediate
these
methylation
events
.

Using
an
antiserum
directed
against
Lys36
methylation
in
H3
,
we
show
that
Set2
,
via
its
SET
domain
,
is
responsible
for
methylation
at
this
site
in
vivo
.

Tethering
of
Set2
to
a
heterologous
promoter
reveals
that
Set2
represses
transcription
,
and
part
of
this
repression
is
mediated
through
the
HMT
activity
of
the
SET
domain
.

The
terminal
components
of
this
cascade
,
two
PGE
(
2
)
synthases
(
PGES
)
,
have
very
recently
been
identified
as
glutathione

.

In
contrast
,
mSin3B
recruitment
to
certain
promoters
did
not
require
p107
or
p130
,
suggesting
that
recruitment
of
this
corepressor
can
occur
via
E2F
-
dependent
and
-
independent
mechanisms
.

OBJECTIVE

To
investigate
PML

in

METHODS
:
Cell

,
PML

,
and

Apoptosis

The
expression
of
PML
mRNA
had
no
change
in
all
the
three
cell
lines
after
treatment
with
ATRA
or

PML
in

plays
a
role
of
apoptosis

and
growth
control
of
leukemia
cells
.

Cdc7
-
Dbf4
kinase
complexes
,
conserved
widely
in
eukaryotes
,
play
essential
roles
in
initiation
and
progression
of
the
S
phase
.

We
have
isolated
and
characterized
the
promoter
region
of
the
human
ASK
gene
encoding
Dbf4
-
related
regulatory
subunit
for
human
Cdc7
kinase
.

Heat
shock
proteins
play
central
roles
in
ensuring
the
correct
folding
and
maturation
of
cellular
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
studies
with
K562
cells
reveal
that
disruption
of
the
interaction
with
Hsp70
slows
the
protein
kinase
C
beta
II
-
mediated
recovery
of
cells
from
PMA
-
induced
growth
arrest
.

Last
,
we
show
that
other
members
of
the
AGC
superfamily
(
Akt
/
protein
kinase
B
and
protein
kinase
A
)
also
bind
Hsp70
via
their
unphosphorylated
turn
motifs
.

There
is
evidence
that
DNA
-

protein
kinase
(
DNA

PK
)
mediates
CpG
signaling
.

Telomerase
activity
is
closely
correlated
with

.

Ubiquitin
-

proteolysis
of
securin
and
mitotic
cyclins
is
essential
for

.

Little
is
known
about
the
molecular
reaction
resulting
in
APC

substrate
ubiquitination
or
the
role
of
individual
APC
subunits
in

.

GTPase
-
activating
proteins
for
Cdc42
.

A
group
of
proteins
called
GTPase
-
activating
proteins
(
GAPs
)
catalyze
the
hydrolysis
of
GTP
to
GDP
,
thereby
inactivating
Cdc42
.

We
identified
another
putative
GAP
for
Cdc42
and
named
it
Rga2
(
Rho
GTPase
-
activating
protein
2
)
.

For
example
,
deletion
of
RGA1
,
but
not
RGA2
or
BEM3
,
caused
hyperinvasive
growth
.

A
second
C
-
terminal
site
,
S112
,
directly
affects
binding
of
4E
-
BP1
to
eIF4E
without
influencing
phosphorylation
of
other
sites
.

Furthermore
,
trans
-
activation
of
cyclin
D3
by
ER
-
E2F1
occurs
even
in
the
presence
of
the
protein
synthesis
inhibitor
cycloheximide
and
thus
appears
direct
.

In
this
study
,
the
consequences
of
LPS
-
induced
PI
3
-
kinase
activation
on
cytokine
and
chemokine
expression
and
the
intracellular
mechanisms
of
inflammatory
activation
were
examined
in
mouse
macrophages
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
demonstrate
that
activation
of
Toll
-
like
receptor
(
TLR
)
-
4
results
in
PI
3
-
kinase
-
MyD88
complex
formation
,
and
that
PI
3
-
kinase
activity
selectively
leads
to
cytokine
induction
downstream
of
TLR4
.

When
E2F1
was
cotransfected
with
HBx
,
E2F1
overcame
the
repressive
effect
of
HBx
on
the
p53
promoter
through
the
E2F1
site
.

These
disulfide
bonds
produce
a
heterogeneous
array
of
oligomers
,
including
some
species
that
can
form
an
active
complex
with
TLR4
.

Selective
inhibition
studies
with
PD98059
,
SB202190
,
SP600125
,
and
the
dominant
negative
JNK
indicate
that
activation
of
JNK
but
not
p38
kinase
or
ERK
kinase
is
required
for
the
phosphorylation
and
transcriptional
activation
of
ATF2
.

which
were

are
also
essential

of
the
IRF3

.

Expression
of
hdm2
,
and
its
mouse
orthologue
mdm2
,
is
known
to
be
induced
by
p53
,
but
recent
evidence
has
demonstrated
mdm2
expression
can
also
be
regulated
via
p53

.

However
the
p53

mechanisms
that
control
transcription
of
the
human
hdm2

have
not
been
studied
.

We
also
demonstrate
considerable

Potent

The
replication
fork
block
protein
Fob1
functions
as
a
negative

of
the
FEAR

We
propose
that
Fob1
helps
to
prevent
the
dissociation
of
Cdc14
from
Cfi1
/
Net1
prior
to
anaphase
and
that
Spo12
activation
during
early
anaphase
promotes
the
release
of
Cdc14
from
its
inhibitor
by
antagonizing
Fob1
function
.

The
p53
signaling
cascade
is
complex
,
and
the
mechanism
by
which

is
cell

.

Using

,
we
have
found
a

of

and
in

Here
,
we
show
that
E2F
directly
participates
in
the
transcriptional
control
of
Arf
in
both
normal

.

In
quiescent

,
this

is
largely
fulfilled
by
E2F3b

E2F3
isoform
whose
function
was
previously
undetermined

Survivin
is
a

The

in

emphasizes
the
importance
of
the

We
speculate
that
hexose

be

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assays
identify
multiple
interactions
of
E2F
proteins
that
include
those
previously
shown
to
activate
and
repress
transcription
.

The
transcriptional
repressor
E2F6
has
been
identified
as
a
component
of
two
distinct
polycomb
group
protein
(
PcG
)
-
containing
complexes
,
suggesting
a
mechanism
for
the
recruitment
of
repressive
complexes
to
target
sequences
in
DNA
.

Whereas
one
complex
is
involved
in
the
repression
of
classic
E2F
target
genes
in
G0
,
a
role
for
E2F6
within
the
cell
cycle
has
yet
to
be
defined
.

Transcriptional
regulation
by
mitogen
-
activated
protein
(
MAP
)
kinase
signaling
cascades
is
a
major
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
development
.

Mutations
that
disrupt
the
concentration
of
Ran
in
the
nucleus
displaced
Mad2p
but
not
Mad1p
from
the
NPC
.

Axin2
is
a
negative
regulator
of
Wnt
/
beta
-
catenin
signalling
with
roles
in
early
development
and
tumour
suppression
.

Second
,
E2F1
induces
stabilisation
of
axin2
mRNAs
.

These
data
have
important
implications
for
understanding
signaling
downstream
of
mTOR
and
the
development
of
new
strategies
to
impair
mTOR
signaling
.

pRB
and
the
p107
/
p130
pair
are
required
for
the
repression
of
distinct
sets
of
genes
,
potentially
due
to
their
selective
interactions
with
E2Fs
that
are
engaged
at
specific
promoter
elements
.

Despite
these
advances
,
much
remains
to
be
learned
about
the
pocket
proteins
,
particularly
with
regard
to
their
developmental
and
tumor
suppressor
functions
.

Moreover
,
inactivation
of
the
target
genes
resulted
in
a
clear
increase
of
cell
viability
(
>
80
%
)
in
response
to
E2F1
activation
compared
with
controls
(
approximately
30
%
)
.

We
report
a
rapid
induction
of
p53
and
increased
expression
of
p21
,
concurrent
with
reduced
levels
of
many
cell
cycle
proteins
that
regulate
G1
to
S
phase
cell
cycle
progression
.

Pretreatment
of
cells
with
cdk
inhibitor
olomoucine
impeded
cdk2
-
cyclin
E
accumulation
,
but
not
the
induction
of
p53
.

Ectopic
expression
of
E2F8
in
diploid
human
fibroblasts
reduces
expression
of
E2F
-
target
genes
and
inhibits
cell
growth
consistent
with
a
role
for
repressing
E2F
transcriptional
activity
.

Similar
to
mammalian
MAP
kinases
,
this
modification
occurs
at
two
amino
acids
of
FUS3
,
threonine
-
180
and
tyrosine
-
182
.

Furthermore
,
an
NFATc2
chimera
protein
containing
the
LxVP
motif
from
NFATc1
interacted
with
CN
much
more
potently
than
did
wild
-
type
NFATc2
.

In
contrast
with
PxIxITc2
,
the
LxVP
peptide
not
only
blocked
CN
-
NFAT
binding
but
also
inhibited
CN
phosphatase
activity
in

.

Regulation
of

Previously
,
Puralpha
protein
was
found
to
bind
to
E2F

,
inhibit

1
transcriptional
activity
,
and
reverse
the
effects
of
ectopic
E2F
-
1
expression
on
cell
growth
.

E2F
-
1
-
associated
activation
of
the
pPuralpha
was
inhibited
by
co
-
expression
of
Puralpha
,
pRb
,
and
an
RNA
species
with
specific
binding
to
E2F
-
1
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
ChIP
)
assay
using
primers
that
flanked
the
juxtaposed
Puralpha
and
E2F

binding
sites
verified
the
presence
of
Puralpha
and
E2F
-
1
on
the
pPuralpha
in
vivo
.

Thus
,
E2F
-
1
and
Puralpha
interplay
appears
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
Puralpha
expression
and
the
cell

.

Deletion
of

of
the
Dkk1

expression
also
increased

The

.

In
budding

,
Gin4
,
a
Nim1

related
kinase
,
plays
an
important
role
in
proper
organization
of
the
septin

at

mother

bud
neck
,
a
filamentous
structure
that
is
critical
for
diverse
cellular
processes
including
mitotic
entry
and
cytokinesis
.

Here
we
showed
that
a
neck
-
associated
Ser
/
Thr
kinase
Elm1
,
which
is
important
for
septin
assembly
,
is
critical
for
proper
modification
of
Gin4
and
its
physiological
substrate
Shs1
.

Consistent
with
these
observations
,
acute
inhibition
of
Elm1
activity
abolished
mitotic
Gin4
phosphorylation
and
Gin4

dependent
Shs1
modification
in

.

In
this
issue
of
Cell
,
Inoki
et

.

(
2006
)
report
that
the
kinases
GSK3
and
AMPK
cooperate
in
the
activation
of
TSC2
to
inhibit
mTOR
activity
.

This
phosphorylation
event
is
required
for
the
normal
temporal
expression
of
cell

cycle
-

genes
such
as
CLB2
and
SWI5
in

of

.

Phosphorylation
of
Rad53
,
and
of

also
requires
a

In
this
study
,
we
determined
the
role
of
PAG608
in
methamphetamine
-
induced

.

Transient

of
PAG608
antisense

We
show
that
ACE2
,
whose
zinc
finger
region
is
nearly
identical
to
that
of
SWI5
,
shows
patterns
of
cell
cycle
-
regulated
transcription
and
nuclear
localization
similar
to
those
seen
previously
for
SWI5
.

Given
that
mTOR
activity
is
frequently
deregulated
in
cancer
,
there
is
much
interest
in
new
strategies
for
inhibition
of
this
pathway
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
report
that
widely
expressed
isoforms
of
unstudied
proteins
termed
Protor
-
1
(
protein
observed
with
Rictor
-

)
and
Protor
-

interact
with
Rictor
and
are
components
of
mTORC2
.

E2F

1
controls
multiple
cellular
activities
through
transcriptional
regulation
of
its
target

.

Moreover
,
endogenous
E2F

1
upregulates
PAC1
and
suppresses
ERK
activity
,
leading
to
cell
death
in
response
to

HPR
.

Our
data
provide
strong
evidence
for
a
distinct
checkpoint
pathway
responding
to
lack
of
sister
kinetochore
tension
,
in
which
Ipl1p

phosphorylation
of
Mad3p
is
a
key
step
.

Differentiation

Here
,
we
present
data
that
is
consistent
with
there
being
multiple

.

Neither
conditional

nor
mutants
of
BIR1
that
disrupt
the
interaction
between
Bir1p
and
Sli15p
resulted
in
mono

,
suggesting
that
the

complex
functions
in
anaphase
and
independently
from

.

Global

shows
that

are
bound
by
both
Ace2

Fkh1

An
important
component
in
the
energy

pathways
is
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
,
a
kinase
that
regulates
cell

.

These
results
have
important
implications
for
our
understanding
of
how
these
pathways
might
be
altered
in
metabolic
diseases
and
cancer
.

In

essential
for

In

Promyelocytic

(

BACKGROUND
:
Promyelocytic
leukemia
(
PML
)
tumor
suppressor
gene
plays
a
key
role
in
acute
PML
pathogenesis
but
its
involvement
in
pathogenesis
and
prognosis
of
solid
cancers
has
not
been
defined
yet
.

OS
in
the
group
of
patients
without
PML
expression
,
with
focal
expression
,
and
with
diffuse
expression
was
40
,

,
and
77

,
respectively
(

.

Cellular

The
addition
of

Aberrant

caused
by
altered
Frizzled

activity
or
by

in

components
has
been
implicated
in
several
adult
pathologies
.

In
conclusion
,
the
TCDD
-
mediated
activation
of
NFATc1
is
suggested
to
promote
cell
migration
via
ATX
/
LPA
-
signaling
.

Delivery

,
serum
progesterone
,
and
nuclear

of
the

(
NFkappaB
)
were
determined
.

CONCLUSION
:
E
coli
-
induced
preterm
delivery
in
the
mouse
is
completely
dependent
upon
MyD88
but
not
TRIF
.

These

were
attenuated
by
ERK
,
phosphatidylinositol

(
PI3K
)
,
NF

,
and

.

Previously
,
we
have
shown
that
leukemic
cells
of
most
ATL
patients
express
CCR4
,
a
chemokine
receptor
known
to
be
selectively
expressed
by
T
cell
subsets
such
as
Th2
cells
,
skin

homing
memory

effector
T
cells
,
and
regulatory
T
cells
.

Our
previous
study
showed
that
overexpression
of
Notch1
could
inhibit
human
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
cell
growth
by
arresting
the
cell
cycle
and
inducing
apoptosis
.

The
data
suggest
that
enhancement
of
TRAIL
-
induced
apoptosis
by
Notch1
signaling
is
dependent
upon
p53
up
-
regulation
.

Therefore
,
therapeutic
NF
-
kappaB
inhibitors
should
be
thoroughly
studied
before
their
clinical
use
in
treating
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
as
undesirable
genes
may
be
upregulated
through
unknown
mechanisms
,
possibly
resulting
in
worse
symptoms
.

Methylation
of
lysine
9
on
histone
H3
(
H3K9
)
is
widely
associated
with
transcriptional
silencing
,
and
its
disappearance
is
linked
to
the
activation
of
several
inflammatory
genes
by
NF

kappaB
.

NF
-
kappaB
essential
modulator
(
NEMO
)
caused
phosphorylation
and
stabilization
of
c
-
Myc
protein
in
the
nucleus
through
direct
interaction
.

Compared
to
the
classical
role
as
an
essential
subunit
for
the
activity
of
IKK
complex
,
stabilization
of
c
-
Myc
by
direct
interaction
is
a
unique
function
of
NEMO
,
representing
a
new
mechanism
to
regulate
c
-
Myc
activity
.

Moreover
,
nuclear
IRS
-

is
recruited
to
the
cyclin
D1
promoter
both
in
MCF

and
BT
-

cells
.

Angiotensin
II
(
Ang
II
)
is
a
major
vasoactive
peptide
of
the
renin
-
angiotensin
system
.

Most
of
the
known
pathophysiological
effects
of
Ang
II
are
mediated
through
Ang
type1
receptors
(
AT
(
1
)
Rs
)
,
and
the
up
-
regulation
of
AT
(
1
)
Rs
is
one
of
important
causes
by
which
Ang
II
can
contribute
to
cardiovascular
diseases
.

A
growing
body
of
evidence
has
suggested
that
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
reactive
nitrogen
species
(
RNS
)
play
important
roles
in
the
regulation
of
AT
(
1
)
R
signaling
.

This
prevents
p65
from
binding
to
p300
,
impairs
p65
acetylation
,
and
attenuates
p65
binding
to
its
cognate
promoters
.

We
show
,
however
,
that
combined
inactivation
of
the
enhancer
AP
-
1
and
NF
-
kappaB
recognition
sites
leads
to
an
attenuation
of
the
hMCMV
-
ES
in
the
neonatal
murine
infection
model
,
not
observed
when
each
single
element
is
abolished
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
TGF
-
beta1
suppression
of
inflammation
remain
largely
unexplored
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
TGF
-
beta1
inhibited
TNF
-
alpha
-
or
IL
-
1
-
induced
RANTES
expression
in
human
kidney
tubular
epithelial
cells
(
HKC
-
8
)
.

We
found
that
TGF
-
beta1
induced
glycogen
synthase
kinase
-
3beta
(
GSK
-
3beta
)
phosphorylation
on
Ser
-
9
in
HKC
-
8
cells
,
leading
to
its
inactivation
.

The
N
-
terminal
region
of
p65
is
necessary
for
both
the
interaction
with
Keap1
and
its
transcriptional
suppression
activity
.

However
,
the
functional
significance
of
Forkhead
Box
M1
transcription
factor
in
laryngeal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
and
the
correlation
between
Forkhead
Box
M1
transcription
factor
and
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
remain
unclear
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
C
/
EBPalpha
or
its
AML
mutants
synergize
with
NF
-
kappaB
p50
to
activate
antiapoptotic
genes
,
including
BCL2
and
FLIP
.

Although
p50
homodimers
inhibit
transcription
,
C
/
EBPalpha
and
p50
synergistically
activate
antiapoptotic
genes
.

The
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
regulates
genes
that
function
in
diverse
cellular
processes
like
inflammation
,
immunity
and
cell
survival
.

Unlike
wild

type
optineurin
,
the
H486R
mutant
did
not
inhibit
tumour

alpha
(
TNFalpha
)

.

such
as

and

This

TRAF6
,
catalyses
the
formation
of
a

We
find
that
the

phosphorylates
and
activates
IKK
in
a
manner
that
depends
on
TRAF6

Moreover
,
the

of
TAK1

We

Subtle
differences
in

Given
that
both
the

it

possible
that

Here
we

The

Activation

A
single

of
DEN
induced
a
centrilobular
p53

that
peaked
at

.

The
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
EAF

are
initiated
via
epigenetic
mechanisms
.

Consistent
with
a
role
of
this

cell

physiology
,
cells
lacking
Msg5
displayed
an
increased

to
the

Congo

.

Under
activating
conditions
,
a
decrease
in
the
affinity
between
Msg5
and
Slt2
was
observed
,
leading
us
to
suggest
that
the
mechanism
by
which
Slt2
controls
the
action
of
Msg5
was
via
the
modulation
of
protein

protein
interactions
.

Histones
H3
and
H4
simultaneously
become
hyperacetylated
,
but
it
remains
unclear
whether
this
is
a
prerequisite
or
a
consequence
of
E2F
binding
.

In
our
hands
,
ectopically
expressed
E2F1
also

the

)
to
target

in

.

Delayed
gammaH2AX
phosphorylation
and
absence
of
ATM
autophosphorylation
at
Ser1981
suggest
that
E2F1
stimulates
ATM
through
a
unique
mechanism
that
is
distinct
from
agents
that
cause
DNA
double

strand
breaks
.

In
this

,
we
showed
that
the
transcription
of
human

,
but
not
by

Fibroblast
growth
factor
receptor

(

gene
expression
is
positively

We
recently
reported
that
FGFR1

was
up

by
Sp
transcription
factors
in

.

The
physiological
and
pathological
roles
of
RIP2
are
mediated
through
its

in
multiple
NF

pathways
,
including
those
triggered
by
tumor

.

Although
there
is
ample
evidence
that
p21
induction
by
p53
leads
to
Cdk2
inhibition
,
it
is
unclear
whether
this
checkpoint
event
also
leads
to
Cdk4
inhibition
.

The
induced
p21
binds
to
both
the
Cdk4
/
cyclin
D
and
Cdk2
/
cyclin
E
complexes
and
inhibits
both
of
their
kinase
activities
.

Together
,
these
findings
establish
that
activation
of
the
p53
-
p21
pathway
is
responsible
for
the
DAP
-
induced
G
(
1
)
-
phase
checkpoint
response
and
provide
the
first
solid
evidence
that
p21
induction
by
p53
during
a
DNA
damage

G

inhibits
both
Cdk4

.

E2F
transcription

play
a
pivotal
role
in
the

of

and
can
be
subdivided
into
activating
and

family
members

plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
switch
between

In
addition
,
we
identified
a
C

domain
,
which
is
independent
of
Ssn6

and

and
functions
at

Dietary
heme
iron
is
an
important
nutritional
source
of

in
carnivores

omnivores
that
is
more
readily
absorbed
than
non

heme
iron
derived
from

.

We
show
that
GSK3beta
/
Axin
complexes
are
rapidly
(
t1
/

<
3
min
)
disrupted
upon
Wnt
stimulation
and
that
changes
in
GSK3beta

substantially
precede
both
beta

and
Axin

.

Kinetic
analysis
demonstrated
that
autophosphorylation
results
in
a
more
than
9

fold
increase
in
protein
kinase
activity
.

Autophosphorylation
was
Rad53
concentration

,
indicating
that
the
reaction
follows
an
intermolecular
mechanism
.

In
contrast
to
previous
studies
in
which
components
of
the
growth

pathways
were
overexpressed
,
hdm2
mRNA
expression
is
not
induced
with
immediate

early
kinetics
in
these
cells
.

Phosphorylation
of
the
chromosomal
passenger
protein
Bir1
is
required
for
localization
of
Ndc10
to
the

during
anaphase
and
full
spindle
elongation
.

Here
we
report
that
,
in
contrast
to
uninfected
cells
,
mdm2
was
undetectable
upon
treatment
of
infected
fibroblasts
with
the
proteasome
inhibitor
MG132
.

Short

restored
the
ability
of
HCMV

to
accumulate

Loss

increases
mammalian

.

Thus
,
tuberin

to

is
sequestered
away
from
its

(

and
its

(

.

p21

Experimental

revealed
that
the
membrane

bound
osmosensor
Sho1
is
phosphorylated
by
Hog1
and
that
phosphorylation
occurs
on
Ser
-
166
.

Moreover
,
Sho1
exists
in
a
homo
-
oligomeric
complex
,
and
phosphorylation
by
Hog1
promotes
a
transition
from
the
oligomeric
to
monomeric
state
.

PRAS40

Immediately
carboxyl

are
two

followed
by
two
acidic

.

The
deacetylated
p53
binds
poorly
to
the
target

,
which
results
in
switching
off
the

,
essential
for
re

entry
into
the

.

Overall
,
our
results
indicate
that
nimbolide
can
sensitize
tumor
cells
to
chemotherapeutic
agents
through
interaction
with
IKK
,
leading
to

of

.

The
requirement
for
p50
NF

in
TNF

expression
may
be
associated
with
its
interaction
with
and

by

,
which
appears
to
be
dominant
over
the
requirement
for

Together
,
these

elucidate

in
the

of

In

,
oroxylin

involved
in

These

demonstrate
that

although
whether
the

The

These

position
the

as

resulted
in
an
insignificant
change
in

These

Upon

,
GSK3beta
is
inhibited
through
an

mechanism
involving
Dishevelled

resulting
in
the
dephosphorylation

of
beta

,
which
translocates
to
the

to
activate

.

In

,
which
normally
connects
IKK
to

,
no

Surprisingly
,
however
,
of

only

Analysis
of
promoter
binding
by
the
E2F
and
pRB
families
in

:
distinct
E2F
proteins
mediate

.

The
E2F
transcription
factor
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
timely
activation
of
gene
expression
during
mammalian
cell
cycle
progression
,
whereas
pRB
and
related
proteins
control
cell
growth
in
part
through
the
ability
to
block
the
action
of
E2F
.

To
identify
physiologically
important
E2F

responsive
promoters
and
to
study
their
occupancy
and
histone
acetylation
state
in
vivo
,
we
have
taken
advantage
of
a
cross
-
linking
approach
in
synchronized
,
living
cells
.

These
findings
suggest
that
repression
and
activation
of
E2F
-
responsive
genes
may
occur
through
distinct
E2F
heterodimers
that
direct
the
sequential
recruitment
of
enzymes
able
to
deacetylate
and
then
acetylate
core
histones
.

Loss

was
observed
in
50
%
of

Here
we
show
that

in

In

,
we
found
that
Syk
played
a

through

The
truncated

transcript
lacks
exon

with
a

of

.

However
,
cells
cease
to
be
viable
if
the
interaction
between
NTF2
and
nucleoporins
is
abolished
completely
,
indicating
that
this
interaction
is
essential
for
the
function
of
NTF2
in

.

In
addition
,
we
have
isolated
a
dominant
negative
mutant
of
NTF2
,
N77Y
,
which
has
increased
affinity
for
nucleoporins
.

The
enzyme
was
inhibited
by
1
mM

,
but
not
by

mM
beta

alanine
.

These
properties
of

,
except
the
inhibition
by
beta

,
were
similar
to
the
rat

.

Some
of

do
not
require

localization
to
their

.

In
contrast
,
hCdc14a
does
not
affect
the

of

(

.

hCdc14a
is
a
major

for

While
the
role
of
Hex

has
been

,
the
physiological
significance
of
labile
Hex

has
remained
unclear
.

Hydrolysis
of

by
the

by
the

.

TIP41
interacts
with
TAP42
and
negatively

.

Here
,
we
describe
TIP41
,
a
conserved
TAP42

interacting
protein
involved
in
the
regulation
of
SIT4
.

This
protein
occupies
E3RS
in
a
specific
and
stoichiometric
manner
,
stabilizes
the
E3
component
,
and
is
likely
responsible
for
its
nuclear
localization
.

Here
we
show
that
effective
activation
of
RF
+
B
cells
is
mediated
by
IgG2a
-
chromatin
immune
complexes
and
requires
the
synergistic
engagement
of
the
antigen

and
a
member
of
the

The

system
has
been
recently
implicated
in
various
aspects
of
transcriptional

,
including
proteasome

degradation
of

activators
.

The
murine
and
porcine
L

genes
(
TDH
)
have
been
identified
previously
,
but
the
human

has
not

.

Despite

of
Stathmin
and
AIM

Here
,
we
show
that
a
BRCA

(
BRCT
)
domain
-
containing
region
of
NBS1
interacts
with
a
nuclear
dots

,
SP100
.

These
results
indicate
that
NBS1
is
recruited
into
PODs
via
interaction
with
SP100
protein
.

homologous
to

Furthermore

p105
(

protein
on

in

.

Thus
,
it
appears
that
reduced
p105
recruitment
of
betaTrCP
and
subsequent
ubiquitination
may
contribute
to
delayed
p105
proteolysis
after

Our

Both

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which

is
not
clear
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that

These

point
to
a

The

evident
,
because

,
the

was
10

confirming
the

It
is
essential
that

support
the

Our

The

We

This
is
particularly
surprising
because
yeasts

down
were
protected
against

Thus

In

We
provide

To

which
enabled
us
to
determine
NF

NF

is
at

with

that
in

Evidence
is
presented
showing
that
DFX
treatment
reduces
TNF

(

by
inhibiting
its

(

enhancing
its
inactivation
through

to

type

(

.

To
test
this
apparent
discrepancy
,
we
realized
that
HTB
and
triflusal
(
but
neither
aspirin
nor
salicylate
)
produced
a
concentration

inhibition
of

The
action
of
glucocorticosteroids
is
mediated
through
glucocorticoid
receptors
present
in
the
cellular
cytoplasm
.

Through
these
actions
glucocorticosteroids
are
susceptible
to
modify
functions
of
cells
involved
in
the
allergic
inflammatory
response
.

Expression
of
the
alpha
-
chain
of
IL
-
2Ralpha
on
peripheral
blood
monocytes
(
PBM
)
was
induced
by
M
.
tuberculosis
by
flow

evaluation
.

The
IL
-
2Ralpha
promoter
containing
the
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
site
was
transcriptionally
induced
by
M
.
tuberculosis
and
this
NF
-
kappaB
site
could
confer
inducibility
to
a
heterologous
herpes
thymidine
kinase
(
TK
)
promoter
by
M
.
tuberculosis
.

Using
antibodies
against
the
p50
and
p65
subunits
of
NF
-
kappaB
in
EMSAs
,
the
involvement
of
both
p50
and
p65
proteins
was
further
demonstrated
.

Treatment
of
T
cells
with
a
variety
of
stimuli
,
including
TNF
-
alpha
,
leads
to
the
translocation
of
the
active
p65
-
50
heterodimer
to
the
nucleus
,
albeit
at
a
lower
level
in
T
cells
from
the
elderly
.

Next
,
we
demonstrated
that
these
viral
ligands
directly
up
-
regulated
monocyte
gene
expression
upon
their
binding
to
their
appropriate
cellular
receptors
.

Because
these
induced
gene
products
have
NF
-
kappaB
sites
in
their
promoter
regions
,
we
next
examined
whether
there
was
an
up
-
regulation
of
nuclear
NF
-
kappaB
levels
.

Lastly
,
we
demonstrated
that
p38
kinase
activity
played
a
central
role
in
IL
-
1beta
production
and
that
it
was
rapidly
up
-
regulated
following
infection
.

We
conclude
that
okadaic
acid
-
induced
IL
-
6
gene
expression
is
at
least
partly
mediated
through
the
ERK1
/
2
and
JNK
pathway
-
dependent
activation
of
NF
-
kappa
B
transcriptional
capacity
.

Although
it
can
be
incorporated
into
the
DNA
of
dividing
cells
,
fludarabine
is
also
a
potent
inhibitor
of
cells
with
a
low
growth
fraction
,
thus
it
must
have
other
mechanisms
of
action
.

This
loss
of
STAT1
was
also
seen
in
cells
from
patients
treated
with
fludarabine
in
vivo
.

These
conflicting
observations
may
be
due
to
different
effects
of
anti
-
inflammatory
agents
on
adhesion
molecule
and
Hsp
expression
in
EC
,
respectively
.

In

,
improves
the
parameters

investigated
the

Analogous
to

this

through

.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
aimed
to
find
the
transcriptional
mechanisms
that
regulate
the
IL
-
5
gene
to
selectively
control
IL
-
5
synthesis
.

Regulation
of
low
shear
flow
-
induced
HAEC
VCAM
-
1
expression
and
monocyte
adhesion
.

However
,
we
report
in
vitro
experimental
studies
in
which
IL
-
10
primed
leukocytes
and
led
to
an
enhanced
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
upon
further
stimulation
by
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
.

When
isolated
PBMC
were
first
cultured
for
20
h
in
the
presence
of
IL
-
10
on
Teflon
to
prevent
adherence
,
washed
to
remove
IL
-
10
and
then
further
cultured
in
plastic
dishes
for
an
additional
20
h
in
the
presence
of
LPS
or
IL
-
1beta
,
an
enhanced
release
of
TNF
was
observed
.

Different
sequence
requirements
for
expression
in
erythroid
and
megakaryocytic
cells
within
a
regulatory
element
upstream
of
the
GATA
-
1
gene
.

Strict
dependence
of
HS
I
activity
on
a
GATA
site
implies
that
assembly
of
a
protein
complex
containing
a
GATA
-
factor
,
presumably
GATA
-
1
or
GATA
-
2
,
is
critical
to
activating
or
maintaining
its
function
.

Adhesion
assays
under
physiological
shear
flow
conditions
showed
that
firm
arrest
,
spreading
,
and
transmigration
of
monocytes
on
TNF
-
alpha
-
activated
endothelium
was
markedly
inhibited
by
IkappaB
-
alpha
overexpression
.

In
this
report
,
we
show
that
two
tyrosines
,
Tyr
-
113
and
Tyr
-
128
,
of
SLP
-
76
are
required
for
its
binding
to
Vav
,
both
in
vitro
and
in
intact
cells
.

These
results
point
out
the
involvement
of
NF
-
kappa
B
/
Rel
family
proteins
in
growth
signaling
pathways
by
either
regulating
proteins
involved
in
the
IL
-
2
signaling
or
by
functionally
interfering
with
the
cell
cycle
progression
.

LP
T
cells
exhibit
enhanced
IL
-
2
secretion
when
activated
through
the
CD2
pathway
.

Furthermore
,
CD28
coligation
fails
to
enhance
IL
-
2
promoter
-
reporter
or
RE
/
AP
construct
expression
in
CD2
-
activated
LPMC
.

Here
we
show
that
the
lymphoid
lineage
-
determining
factors
Ikaros
and
Aiolos
can
function
as
strong
transcriptional
repressors
.

Therefore
,
IRF
-
1
may
be
an
important
contributor
to
IL
-
12
signaling
,
and
we
speculate
that
the
defective
IL
-
12
responses
seen
in
IRF
-
1
-
/
-
mice
might
be
attributable
,
in
part
,
to
the
absence
of
this
transcription
factor
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
our
current
understanding
of
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
T
cell
development
and
function
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
results
of
recent
gene
targeting
and
transgenic
experiments
.

We
find
that
PU
.
1
interacts
directly
with
GATA
-
1
,
a
zinc
finger
transcription
factor
required
for
erythroid
differentiation
.

We
also
show
that
ectopic
expression
of
PU
.
1
in
Xenopus
embryos
is
sufficient
to
block
erythropoiesis
during
normal
development
.

Clinicians
are
only
just
beginning
to
recognize
subclinical
markers
of
response
,
and
it
may
soon
be
possible
to
predict
response
on
the
basis
of
genetic
composition
.

Only
through
considered
evaluation
of
clinical
evidence
may
clinicians
determine
which
therapies
should
remain
novelties
and
which
should
become
an
accepted
part
of
the
armamentarium
.

The
intracellular
parasite
Theileria
parva
protects
infected
T
cells
from
apoptosis
.

A
high
expression
of
WT1
has
been
detected
in
a
range
of
acute
leukemias
,
and
WT1
is
downregulated
during
induced
differentiation
of
some
leukemic
cell
lines
.

Overexpression
of
WT1
in
some
myeloid
cell
lines
confers
resistance
to
differentiation
induction
.

Inhibition
of
NF
-
kappaB
transcriptional
activity
and
promotion
of
IkappaBalpha
degradation
.

DZA
inhibits
the
transcriptional
activity
of
NF
-
kappaB
through
the
hindrance
of
p65
(
Rel
-
A
)
phosphorylation
without
reduction
of
its
nuclear
translocation
and
DNA
binding
activity
.

The
reduction
of
IkappaBalpha
by
DZA
is
neither
involved
in
IkappaB
kinase
complex
activation
nor
modulated
by
the
addition
of
homocysteine
.

STAT1
activity
was
evident
on
the
STAT
binding
sequences
(
SBE
)
present
in
the
promoters
of
genes
which
are
up
-
regulated
during
monocyte
to
macrophage
maturation
such
as
FcgammaRI
and
ICAM
-
1
,
and
in
the
promoter
of
the
transcription
factor
IFN
regulatory
factor
-
1
.

Some
pulmonary
diseases
like
bronchitis
or
asthma
bronchiale
are
mediated
by
inflammatory
mechanisms
in
bronchial
epithelial
cells
.

Protein
tyrosine
kinase
activity
,
NF
-
kappaB
activity
,
and
the
synthesis
of
cytokine
-
specific
mRNA
were
inhibited
by
antioxidants
.

These
data
suggest
a
ROI
-
dependent
NF
-
kappaB
mediated
transcription
of
inflammatory
cytokines
in
bronchial
epithelial
cells
.

In
addition
to
Bcl
-
x
,
a
known
CD40
-
regulated
antiapoptotic
molecule
,
we
identified
a
related
antiapoptotic
molecule
,
A1
/
Bfl
-
1
,
as
a
CD40
-
inducible
gene
.

Clusters
of
genes
expressed
by
stromal
cells
and
lymphocytes
in
the
breast
tumors
also
were
identified
in
this
analysis
.

We
have
found
that
Bcl
-
2
overexpression
leads
to
the
prevention
of
chemotherapy
(
paclitaxel
)
-
induced
expression
of
FasL
and
blocks
paclitaxel
-
induced
apoptosis
.

Thus
,
it
appears
that
paclitaxel
and
other
drugs
that
disturb
microtubule
function
kill
cells
at
least
in
part
through
the
induction
of
FasL
.

Oct
-
1
,
a
POU
domain
transcription
factor
,
was
identified
as
a
repressor
of
HLA
-
DRA
promoter
activity
in
the
Rb
-
defective
cells
.

These
results
indicate
that
within
the
TCR
/
CD3
signal
transduction
pathway
both
PKC
and
calcineurin
are
required
for
the
effective
activation
of
the
IKK
complex
and
NF
-
kappaB
in
T
lymphocytes
.

Eosinophil
granule
major
basic
protein
(
MBP
)
is
expressed
exclusively
in
eosinophils
and
basophils
in
hematopoietic
cells
.

In
the
cell
line
HT93A
,
which
is
capable
of
differentiating
towards
both
the
eosinophil
and
neutrophil
lineages
in
response
to
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
,
C
/
EBPalpha
mRNA
expression
decreased
significantly
concomitant
with
eosinophilic
and
neutrophilic
differentiation
,
whereas
C
/
EBPbeta
expression
was
markedly
increased
.

Tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
and
interleukin
-
7
(
IL
-
7
)
,
secreted
during
this
interaction
,
are
critical
cytokines
for
HIV
long
terminal
repeat
transactivation
through
NF
-
kappaB
-
dependent
activation
.

Although
the
role
of
CD28
in
T
cell
costimulation
is
firmly
established
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
it
exerts
its
costimulatory
actions
are
less
clear
.

NF
-
kappaB
nuclear
translocation
is
secondary
to
the
phosphorylation
and
subsequent
degradation
of
the
NF
-
kappaB
inhibitory
molecule
IkappaBalpha
.

IkappaBalpha
degradation
and
NF
-
kappaB
nuclear
translocation
correlate
with
transcriptional
activation
of
the
inflammatory
cytokines
TNF
-
alpha
and
IL
-
1beta
.

We
further
explored
the
effect
of
dopamine
in
the
presence
of
phorbol
esters
or
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNF
-
alpha
)
known
to
activate
NF
-
kappaB
.

The
combination
of
dopamine
and
TNF
-
alpha
led
to
a
stimulation
of
HIV
-
1
transcription
and
replication
.

However
,
in
contrast
with
TNF
-
alpha
,
dopamine
treatment
did
not
affect
NF
-
kappaB
DNA
binding
activity
nor
the
concentrations
of
p50
,
p65
and
IkappaB
-
alpha
proteins
,
which
suggests
a
distinct
NF
-
kappaB
activation
mechanism
.

Because
the
elevated
Myb
:
Maf
status
seen
in
differentiating
cells
can
be
recapitulated
by
overexpression
of
c
-
Maf
in
myeloid
cell
lines
,
we
inducibly
expressed
the
c
-
Maf
cDNA
in
2
bipotent
human
myeloid
progenitor
cells
.

Neutrophil
maturation
and
the
role
of
retinoic
acid
.

Here
we
present
a
review
of
the
mechanism
of
retinoic
acid
receptor
action
and
the
major
evidence
showing
that
normal
retinoid
signaling
is
required
for
neutrophil
maturation
.

However
,
the
mechanism
by
which
IFNs
mediate
this
inhibition
has
not
been
defined
.

ROS
generation
inhibition
paralleled
NF
-
kappaB
levels
in
the
nucleus
.

In
circulating
T
cells
from
a
subset
of
patients
with
RCCs
,
the
suppression
of
NFkappaB
binding
activity
is
downstream
from
the
stimulus
-
induced
degradation
of
the
cytoplasmic
factor
IkappaBalpha
.

The
inhibitory
agent
has
several
features
characteristic
of
a
ganglioside
,
including
sensitivity
to
neuraminidase
but
not
protease
treatment
;
hydrophobicity
;
and
molecular
weight
less
than
3
kDa
.

The
flow
of
information
from
calcium
-
mobilizing
receptors
to
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
-
dependent
genes
is
critically
dependent
on
interaction
between
the
phosphatase
calcineurin
and
the
transcription
factor
NFAT
.

LTB4
increased
the
expression
of
the
c
-
fos
gene
in
a
time
-
and
concentration

manner
.

The

This

of

Negative

in

appears
to
be
a

inversion
of
antigen
responsiveness
:
instead
of
turning
on

,
the
activated

destroys
its
own

.

It
is
interesting
that
in

cortical

can
still
induce
IL

and
even
be

in

if

Perhaps
murine

are
denied
this
form
of
rescue
because
they
shut
off

ABSTRACT

Enhanced
NF
-
kappa
B
binding
activity
is
followed
by
functional
activation
in
that
inducibility
of
the
IL
-
2
receptor
alpha
chain
is
mediated
by
enhanced
NF
-
kappa
B
binding
and
that
a
heterologous
promoter
containing
the
NF
-
kappa
B
consensus
sequence
(
-
291
to
-
245
)
of
the
IL
-
2
receptor
alpha
chain
gene
is
activated
.

A
modest
(
20
-
50
%
)
reduction
in
TNF
promoter
activity
was
observed
with
the
AP
-
2
site
mutation
.

Rather
,
TNF
and
PMA
can
exert
their
effect
only
if
cells
are
in
an
appropriate
redox
status
,
because
prior
modification
toward
reduction
with
BHA
treatment
prevents
this
activation
.

Sequence
variation
in
the
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
region
of
HIV

was
analyzed
in
viral

of
17
infected
individuals
.

The
transcriptional
activity
of
the
heterodimer
is
regulated
by
signal

dependent
phosphorylation
and
dephosphorylation
events
.

c

Jun
protein
isolated
from
phorbol

did
not
target

which
suggests
that
c

is
transiently
stabilized
after
stimulation
of
cell
growth
.

the

However
,
no

is
observed
,
presumably
reflecting
the
unique
C

that
is
distinct
from

Resolution
of

a
single

fraction
requiring
only
the
addition
of
TFIID
for
the
initiation
of
transcription
at
RNA

promoters
.

In
contrast
to
the
transient
NF

kappa
B
activation
induced
by
phorbol
ester
,
the
permanent
NF
-
kappa
B
translocation
induced
by
HIV
infection
was
not
dependent
on
PKC
isoenzymes
alpha
and
beta
as
shown
by
the
use
of
a
specific
inhibitor
(
GF

)
.

Con
A
stimulation
was
found
to
increase
both
binding

to
the
AP

consensus
sequence
,
TRE
,
and
AP

1
enhancer
activity
,
in
Jurkat
cells
.

We
conclude
that
stimulation
with
mitogenic
lectins
is
sufficient
to
increase
both
c

Fos
and
c
-
Jun
protein
levels
,
AP

1
binding
and
AP
-
1
enhancer
activity
in
Jurkat
cells
and
that
they
act
via
mechanisms
that
could
involve
the
activation
of
PKC
.

Treatment
with
okadaic
acid
resulted
in
a
striking
increase
in
TNF

alpha
mRNA
transcripts
within
1
h
of
stimulation
and
large
amounts
of
TNF

were
released
into

were

Our

show
that

that
this

The

likely
contributes
to
the

.

Using
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
,
we
have
studied
these
transcription
factors
in
primary
T
cells
from
human
blood
to
verify
their
presence
in
a
physiologic
setting
and
to
identify
the
signals
that
stimulate
factor
activity
.

Only
the
activities
for

require
two

for

,
i

e

,
PMA
plus
either
lectin
or

to
the

.

The
transcription
factor
GATA
-
1
is
expressed
in
a
subset
of
hemopoietic
cells
,
where
it
mediates
the
cell

type
specific
expression
of
several
genes
.

The
activity
of
the
enhancer
is
almost
completely
dependent
on
the
integrity
of
a
dimeric
GATA
-

binding
site
.

Primary
structure
analysis
showed
that
the
encoded
protein
contains
three
tandem
zinc

finger
sequences
of
the
type
Cys2
-
Xaa12
-
His2
.

Comparing
the
regulation
of
these
related
zinc
-
finger
-
encoding
genes
showed
coordinate
induction
upon
mitogenic
stimulation
of
resting
T
lymphocytes
and
of
resting

.

Such
transcription
factors
play
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
the
mature
T

cell
phenotype
by
functioning
as
'
master
regulators
of
T
-
cell
differentiation
'
.

To
examine
the
role
of
protein
phosphatases
in
T
cell
activation
,
Jurkat
cells
were
treated
with
okadaic
acid
,
an
inhibitor
of
type
1
and
2A
phosphatases
,
and
nuclear
extracts
were
examined
for
the
presence
of
AP1
as
a
measure
of
early
T
cell
activation
.

Surprisingly
,
while
the
addition
of
phytohemagglutinin
further
enhanced
the
induction
of
AP1
,
the
addition
of
PMA
inhibited
it
.

By
comparison
,
PMA
is
a
very
inefficient
inducer
of
the
jun
gene
family
in
Jurkat
cells
.

Transactivation

in
primary
human

and
identification
of

.

This
study
examines
the
regions
of
the
HIV

required
for
HHV
-
6
transactivation
in
a
heterogeneous
population
of
primary
human
T

with
or
without
antigenic
stimulation
.

However
,
this
mutated
NF

was
not
transactivated
during
HHV

6
(
GS
)
infection
or
after
cotransfection
with
pZVB70
or
pZVB10
.

We
have
therefore
investigated
the
changes
in
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
activity
upon
exposure
of
monocytes
to
M
-
CSF
.

Inhibition
of

The

.

However
,
the
C26

alone
,
even
when
repeated
,
could
not
be
activated
by
p40tax
,
unlike
other
NF

elements
.

Our
results
also
demonstrate
that
TPA

activation
of
the
HTLV

may
be
mediated
through
the
C26

.

Inhibition

.

Previous
studies
have
shown
that
treatment
of
human
myeloid

cells
with
12

O
-
tetradecanoylphorbol
-
13
-
acetate
(

is
associated
with
induction
of
monocytic
differentiation
and
expression
of
the
c

jun
and
c

genes
.

These
findings
suggest
that
dexamethasone
down
-
regulates
TPA
-
induced
transcription
of
the
c

jun
gene
during
monocytic
differentiation
by
inhibiting
activation
of

Glucocorticoids
are
known
to
downregulate
interleukin

beta
production
in

by
two

mechanims
:
direct

of
the

and

of

.

This
difference
was
also
seen
at
the
mRNA
level
.

One
of
the
factors

to
a

Thus
,
depending
on
the
cellular
environment
,
the
short

and
long
-
term
effects
of
Tax
expression
can
be
quite
different
.

The
human

(
HIVs

may
include
a

of
retroviruses
with
varying
potential
to
infect
their

,
undergo
long
periods
of
latent

,
and
induce

.

This

in
HIV

is
the
T

;
in
HIV

,
however
,
it
is
the
second
enhancer
that
is
mainly
responsible
for
activation
in
response
to
T
-
cell
activators
.

These
results
indicate
that
in
monocytic
cell
lineage
,
HIV

could
mimic
some
differentiation

allowing

In
striking
contrast
to
the
mouse
Ig
heavy
-
chain
enhancer
,
in
which
the
octamer
motif
acts
as
a
B

element
,
the
human
enhancer
contains
an
octamerlike
sequence
with
one

which
bound
octamer

proteins
with
only
very
low
affinity
and
showed
no

of
its
own
.

However
,
in
either
EL
-
4
(
T
)
cells
or
S194
cells
,
both
lower

affinity
sites
can
be
significantly
induced
by
the
tax
gene
product
of
human
T

cell
leukemia
virus
type

,
showing
that
NF

activity
can
be
modulated
even
in
a
B

that
constitutively
expresses
this

This

that
hybridized
to
a

RNA
present
in

.

Therefore
the

may
represent
the

of

Recent
development
of
primary
cultures
of
human
megakaryocytes
and
the
molecular
cloning
of
genes
that
are
specific
to
this
lineage
offer
the
possibility
of
getting
some
insights
into
the
genetic
mechanisms
that
control
megakaryocytopoiesis
.

Two

,
respectively
,
bind
proteins
that
are
present
in

cells
and
nonrelated
cells
as
well
.

Finally
,
two
other
domains
,
located
at
positions
-
460
and
-
510
,
interact
with
proteins
that
are
only
present
in

Hydrogen

In
this

,
we
show
that
micromolar
concentrations
of
H2O2
can
induce
the
expression
and
replication
of
HIV
-
1
in
a
human
T
cell
line
.

This
suggests
that
diverse
agents
thought
to
activate
NF
-
kappa
B
by
distinct
intracellular
pathways
might
all
act
through
a
common
mechanism
involving
the
synthesis
of
ROI
.

Southwestern
and
gel
renaturation
experiments
with
the
use
of
purified
protein
fractions
revealed
that
TCF

is
derived
from
a
family
of
57
-
to
53
-
kD
proteins
that
are
abundantly
expressed
in
mature
and
immature
T

cell
lines
(
Jurkat
,
CCRF

and
not
in

that
recognizes

.

However
,
despite
its
ability
to
activate
transcription
of
a
transfected
reporter
gene
,
the
factor
is
apparently
unable
to
bind
to
the
endogenous
Ig
heavy

enhancer
in
non

lymphoid
cells
:
In
previous
experiments
by
others
,
the
characteristic
in

footprint
of
this
factor
,
designated
NF

muE3
,
was
detected
in
B
cells
but
not
in
non

.

Identification
of

with
an

heavy

and
stimulates
transcription
in

with
the

cell
-
specific
factor
OTF2
.

Based
on
these
results
,
we
propose
that
NTF
and
OTF2
interactions
(
both
with
their
cognate
DNA
elements
and
possibly
at
the
protein
-
protein
level
)
may
be
critical
to
B

and
that
these
interactions
provide
additional
pathways
for
regulating
gene
expression
.

within

as
an

in
erythroid

.

Enhancer
activity
appears
to
be
mediated
by
the
binding
of
a
complex
of
proteins
from
the
jun
and
fos
families
to
tandem
AP
-

consensus
sequences
.

Further
results
,
in
which
beta
-
gal
activity
is
correlated
with
NF
-
AT
-
binding
activity
,
indicate
that
the
concentration
of
NF

AT
must
exceed
a
critical
threshold
before
transcription
initiates
.

Similar
constructs
controlled
by
NF
-
kappa
B
or
the
entire
interleukin

2
enhancer
show
bimodal
expression
patterns
during
induction
,
suggesting
that
thresholds
set
by
the
concentration
of
transcription
factors
may
be
a
common
property
of
inducible
genes
.

At
the
end
of
this
incubation
the
resting

were
stimulated
with
M

,
and
RNA
was
isolated
for

by
Northern

.

We
found
a
dissociation
of
NF

kappa
B
translocation
from
transactivation
of
either
the
HIV
LTR
or
the

.

Each
of

are
involved
in

Finally
,
we
demonstrate
that
thrombin
and
TRP
enhanced
CD69
expression
and
interleukin

production
induced
by
T
cell
receptor
cross
-
linking
in
both
Jurkat
T
cells
and
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
.

In
nuclear
run
-
on
analysis
,
such
tolerant
cells
show
only
a
low
degree
of
transcription
,
indicating
that
tolerance
operates
at
or
upstream
of
the
transcription
level
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
tolerance
to
LPS
is
determined
by
post
-
receptor
mechanisms
that
involve
an
altered
composition
of
the
NF

kappa
B
complex
.

We
have
examined
the
effect
of
alpha

tocopherol
(

)
on
one
cellular
event
in
atherosclerotic
plaque
development
,
monocyte
adhesion
to

(
ECs
)
.

Our
results
point
to
a
novel
alternative
mechanism
of
action
of
alpha

.

In
the
second
approach
,
we
tested
the
generality
of
this
phenomenon
by
transiently
expressing
LMP1
from
a
strong
constitutively
active
promoter
in
a
range
of
different
cell
types
.

LPS

resembled
the

in
the

.

These
results
imply
that
TK
activity
is
not
obligatory
for
CD14
-
mediated
signal
transduction
to
occur
in
response
to
LPS
.

To
identify
potential
cellular
homologues
of
cyclosporin
A
that
might
regulate
calcium
signalling
,
we
have
cloned
human
genes
encoding
cyclophilin

proteins
using
the
yeast
two

hybrid
system
.

Since
HUVECs
released
superoxide
anions
in
response
to
TNF
,
and
H2O2
induces

,
PDTC
may
act
as
a

.

Little
is
known
about
how
the
very
early
events
induced
by

cross

linking
link
to
cellular
responses
.

Studies
presented
here
show
that
overall
NF
-
kappa
B
signal
transduction
begins
with
a
parallel
series
of
stimuli
-
specific
pathways
through
which
cytokines
(
tumor

)
,
oxidants
(

and
mitomycin

)
,
and
phorbol
ester
(
phorbol

)
individually
initiate
signaling
.

We
propose
that
adherent
monocytes
regulate
nuclear
processing
(
or
decay
)
of
I

,
thereby

In

leads
to
nuclear
translocation
of
the
p50

p65
subunits
of
the

transcription
factor
,
to
activation
of
a

gene
driven
by
a

containing

,
and
to
increased
levels
of
mRNAs
for
immediate

early
genes
,
including
the
cytokine
interleukin
(
IL
)
-

beta
.

Whereas
different
anti

or
HIV

gp120
could
all
trigger
activation
of
the
protein
tyrosine
kinases
p56lck
and
p59fyn
and
phosphorylation
of
the
Shc
adaptor
protein
,
which
mediates
signals
to
Ras
,
they
differed
significantly
in
their
ability
to
activate

The
results
identify
functionally
distinct
epitopes
on
the

involved
in

of

By

an

NF

results
in
these
phenotypic
abnormalities
because
mice
lacking
both
I

alpha
and
the
p50
subunit
of
NF

show
a
dramatically
delayed
onset
of

.

Our
results
indicate
that
I
kappa

,
but
not
I
kappa
B
alpha
,
is
required
for
the
signal
-
dependent
activation
of

in
fibroblasts
.

The
T
cell
activation
is
initiated
by
interaction
of
specific
Ags
with
TCR
,
followed
by
activation
of
intracellular
biochemical
events
leading
to
activation
of
several
genes
.

Translocation
of

was
also
observed
following

While
a
nuclear
factor
(

from
both
peripheral
blood
monocytes
and
T
cells
binds
the
peri

kappa
B
site
,
electrophoretic
mobility

assays
suggest
that
either
a
different
protein
binds
to
this
site
in
monocytes
versus
T

or
that
the
protein
recognizing
this
enhancer
element
undergoes
differential
modification
in
monocytes
and
T

,
thus
supporting
the

data
.

Taken

,
our
data
suggest
that
p95vav
plays
an
important
role
at
an

thus
play
a

interact
with
signals
from
the
antigen
receptor
to
synergistically
augment
the

properties
of

.

Antigen
receptor
signals
prolong
NF

-
DNA
interaction
,
probably
by
functionally
antagonizing
the
IL

-
induced
synthesis
of
a
protein
(

)
responsible
for
the
transient
NF

interaction
and
consequently
synergistically
enhance

.

The
nuclear
activity
of
NF

kappa
B
is
tightly
regulated
from
the
cytoplasmic
compartment
by
an
inhibitory
subunit
called
I
kappa
B
alpha
.

This
cytoplasmic
inhibitor
is
rapidly
phosphorylated
and
degraded
in
response
to
a
diverse
set
of

-
inducing
agents
,
including
T

mitogens
,

and

,
impaired

Western

showed
that

cysteine
reduced
the
accumulation
of
the

in
LPS
-
treated
cells
,
a
finding
consistent
with
the
results
of
the
immunofluorescence
studies
.

First
,
we
show
that
persistent
HIV

results
in
the
activation
of
NF

not
only
in
monocytic
cells
but
also
in
macrophages
.

Peripheral
blood
mononuclear

from
seventeen
patients
with
primary

were
enriched

blasts
and
tested
for
(

)
karyotype
,
(

and
(

expression
of

,

and
EGR
-

genes
which
are
all
located
on
the
long
arm
of
chromosome
5
.

Aims
of
the
study
were
to
(
1
)
assess
the
potential
role
of
the
expression
of
these
genes
in
the
maintenance
and
expansion
of
the
neoplastic
clones
and
(

)
search
for
constitutional
losses
or
rearrangements
of
one
allele
followed
by
a
deletion
of
the
second
allele
of
the
same
genes
in
the
leukemic
cells
.

Thus
,
deregulation
of
genes
encoding
for
certain
hemopoietic
growth
factors
or
receptors
does
not
seem
to
represent
a
major
mechanism
of
MDS
progression
.

Thus
,
Mn

SOD
RNA
protein
levels
and

were
markedly
reduced
in
the

(

)
,
known
to
transactivate
the

(
LTR
)
,
no
longer
affected
Mn
-
SOD
expression
,
the
cellular
redox

or
TNF

.

Thus
,
our
experiments
demonstrate
that
the
C
-
terminal
region
of
HIV

1
Tat
is
required
to
suppress
Mn

SOD
expression
and
to
induce

reflected
by
a
drop
in
reduced

(

)
and
the

ratio
.

The
results
indicated
that
both
genes
are
expressed
in
T

throughout
their
development
,
supporting
the
notion
that

(

)
and
a

characterization
of
HZF

revealed
that
a
common
feature
of
human
Kruppel
-
related
zinc
finger
proteins
is
the
presence
of
tandem
arrays
of
zinc
fingers
ranging
in
number
from
3
to
over
20
that
are
preferentially
located
in
the
carboxy
-
terminal
regions
of
the
proteins
.

In
addition
,
several
novel
KRAB
-
containing
zinc
finger
genes
and
a
novel
conserved
sequence
element
were
identified
.

This
liberates
NF

kappa

to
translocate
to
the
nucleus
and
initiate
transcription
of
genes
important
for
the
defense
of
the

DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
The
effect
of
all

trans

cis
RA
on
HIV

production
in
T

lymphoid
(
H9
,

and
monocytoid
(
U937
,
THP

)
cell
lines
was
measured
during
acute
and
chronic
infection
.

Several
criteria
indicated
that
the
defect
in
this
cell
line
influences
the
activity
of
an
isotype
-
specific
transcription
factor
.

The
DQB
X2
-
box
was
able
to
restore
expression
to
the
silent
DRA
reporter
construct
.

Additionally
,
infected
T
cells
displayed
lower
levels
of
CD45
on
their
surfaces
.

,
and

development
.

To
identify
ets
-
related
transcriptional
regulators
expressed
in
pre
-
B
lymphocytes
that
may
interact
with
either
the
pi
or
the
microB
site
,
we
have
used
a
PCR
approach
with
degenerate
oligonucleotides
encoding
conserved
sequences
in
all
members
of
the
ets
family
.

Three
additional
smaller
regions
show
homology
to
the
ELK
-
1
and
SAP
-
1
genes
,
a
subgroup
of
the
ets
gene
family
that
interacts
with
the
serum
response
factor
.

The
stimulatory
effects
of
gp160
are
mediated
through
the
CD4
molecule
,
since
pretreatment
with
soluble
CD4
abrogates
its
activity
.

This
inhibition
was
not
mediated
through
Nef
phosphorylation
on
Thr
-
15
or
GTP
-
binding
activity
because
mutations
in
critical
sites
did
not
alter
this
inhibition
.

NM23
was
identified
in
a
system
of
murine
melanoma
cell
lines
,
in
which
an
inverse
relationship
was
found
between
NM23
expression
and
metastatic
ability
.

Therefore
we
investigated
the
modifications
imposed
on
NF
-
kappa
B
/
I
kappa
B
components
following
stimulation
and
show
that
the
final
step
of
NF
-
kappa
B
induction
in
vivo
involves
phosphorylation
of
several
members
of
the
NF
-
kappa
B
/
I
kappa
B
protein
families
.

Our
studies
reveal
that
inactivation
of
the
v
-
abl
protein
tyrosine
kinase
triggers
high
-
frequency
rearrangement
of
kappa
and
lambda
light
-
chain
genes
.

Together
these
data
demonstrate
that
the
v
-
abl
protein
specifically
interferes
with
light
-
chain
gene
rearrangement
by
suppressing
at
least
two
pathways
essential
for
this
stage
of
B
-
cell
differentiation
and
suggest
that
tyrosine
phosphorylation
is
important
in
regulating
RAG
gene
expression
.

HS

was
weak
in
hematopoietic

absent
in

and
greatly
enhanced
in

that
this

might
be
implicated
in
the

investigated
indicated

However
,
PDTC
failed
to
inhibit

The

EL

cells
were
transfected
with
a

containing
the
IL

promoter
and
enhancer
region
linked
to
the
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
(
CAT

.

Based
on
sequence

we
identified
two
binding
motifs
for
Pit
-
1
and
seven
half
-
sites
for
glucocorticoid
receptor
/
progesterone
receptor
(
PR

binding
.

We
focused
our
studies
on
the
role
of
Pit
-
1
and
of
PR
as
potential
transcriptional
regulators
,
since
the
POU
domain
protein
Pit
-
1
is
essential
in
the
control
of
pituitary
PRL
expression
,
and
progesterone
induces
decidual
transformation
of
the
endometrial
stroma
,
a
differentiation
process
during
which
the
decidual
PRL
gene
is
activated
.

Addition
of
rIL

fully
restored
the
proliferative
response
and
partially
restored
the
production
of
IL
-
4
and
IL
-
5
,
but
not
that
of
other
cytokines
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
the
effect
of
IL

4
on
the
expression
of
cytokine
genes
in
monocytes
evoked
by
other
T

helper

cytokines
:
IL

in

stimulated
with
IL

,
IL
-

,
and
GM

CSF
.

This
was
supported
by
the
observation
that
the
down
-
regulatory
capacity
of
IL
-
4
appeared
to
be
dependent
on
de
novo
protein
synthesis
.

Long

.

The
cascade
of
events
within
the
first
few
minutes
of
T
cell
stimulation
has
been
well
characterized
.

To
model
effective
versus
ineffective
CD3

mediated
stimulation
in
peripheral
T
cells
,
we
used
two
anti

CD3
mAbs
that
differ
in
their
ability
to
stimulate
purified
T
cells
:
OKT3
,
which
causes
early
second
messenger
generation
but
is
unable
to
activate
T
cells
without
a
second
signal
,
and
64
.

,
which
stimulates
T
cell
proliferation
on
its
own
.

Binding
of
superantigens
to
MHC
class
II
molecules
results
in
transduction
of
biochemical
signals
leading
to
cellular
activation
and
gene
expression
.

Here
we
report
that
CD28
engagement
,
however
,
exerts
opposite
effects
on
the
transcription
factor
AP
-
1
.

Sequence
homology
,
single
nucleotide
mutations
,
and
anti

CD28
Ab
stimulation
studies
established
that
the
NF
-
kappa
B
-
like
sequence
in
the
promoter
of
the
IL
-
8
gene
functioned
as
a
CD28
response
element
.

The
two
tiny
ring
X
chromosomes
studied
with
an
antibody
specific
for
the
acetylated
isoforms
of
histone
H4
marking
transcribed
chromatin
domains
were
labeled
at
a
level
consistent
with
their
being
active
.

The
P
sequence
of
the
IL

4
gene
,
defined
as
a
responsive
element
for
PMA
and
calcium
ionophore
(
A23187
)
,
shares
sequence
similarity
with
the
NF
kappa
B
and
the
NF
-
activated
T
cell
binding
sites
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
NF

AT
-
like
factors
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
IL
-
4
and
IL

5
genes
.

The
two
human
GATA3
zinc
fingers
are
encoded
by
two
separate
exons
highly
conserved
with
those
of
GATA1
,
but
no
other
structural
homologies
between
these
two
genes
can
be
found
.

The
response
of
mammalian
cells
to
stress
is
controlled
by
transcriptional
regulatory
proteins
such
as
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
-
kappa
B
)
to
induce
a
wide
variety
of
early
response
genes
.

Site
B
(
nt
4519
to
4545
)
specifically
bound
four
distinct
nuclear
protein
complexes
:
a
ubiquitous

,
a
T

,
a
B

,
and
the
monocyte
/
macrophage
-
and
B
-
cell
-
specific
transcription
factor
PU
.
1
/
Spi

.

NF
-
kappa
B
is
a
rapidly
inducible
transcriptional
activator
that
responds
to
a
variety
of
signals
and
influences
the
expression
of
many
genes
involved
in
the
immune
response
.

Very
little
information
exists
linking
these
two
important
classes
of
signaling
molecules
.

On
the
other
hand
,
stimulation
of
T
cells
by
mitogens
or
antibodies
to
the
T
-
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
-
CD3
complex
resulted
in
the
down
-
regulation
of
transcriptional
factors
NF
-
kappa
B
and
AP
-
1
in
cells
expressing
the
nef
gene
compared
with
cells
not
expressing
the
nef
gene
.

We
found
,
moreover
,
that
in
SK
-
N
-
Be
(

)
cells
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
enzymatic
activity
was
much
lower
compared
with
that
in
a
control
cell
line
and
that
the
low
PKC
enzymatic
activity
was
due
to
low
PKC
protein
expression
.

Genes
encoding
general

factors
for

are
dispersed
in
the

General
transcription
factors
are
required
for
accurate
initiation
of
transcription
by
RNA
polymerase

.

However
,
a
TH
-
dependent
positive
effect
is
elicited
by
selective
interaction
of
the
THR

PPAR
but
not
the
THR
alpha
-
PPAR
heterodimer
with
a
novel

.

Incubation
of
human
endothelial
cells
(
ECs
)
in
hypoxia
,
PO2
approximately
14

18
Torr
,
led
to
time
-
dependent
release
of
IL

8
antigen
into
the
conditioned
medium
;
this
was
accompanied
by
increased
chemotactic
activity
for
PMNs
,
blocked
by
antibody
to
IL

8
.

Again
,
in
vitro
supershift
studies
indicate
that
the
presence
of
p50
,
p52
,
p65
,
and
cRel
correlates
with
positive
function
whereas
the
presence
of
only
p50
and
p52
correlates
with
negative
function
.

Targeted
mutagenesis
of
the
GATA

gene
in
embryonic
stem
cells
has
demonstrated
its
requirement
in
normal
erythroid
development

The
transcription
factor
AP
-
1
is
an
important
human
mediator
of
the
cellular
response
to
serum
,
growth
factors
,
and
phorbol
esters
such
as
12
-
O
-
tetradecanoyl
-
phorbol
-
13
acetate
(
TPA
)
.

Recent
findings
suggest
an
involvement
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
the
pathway
of
TPA
and
protein
kinase
C
leading
to
expression
of
c
-
fos
and
c

.

These
studies
support
the
idea
that
superoxide
anion
radical
plays
a
role
in
the
expression
of
c
-
fos
mRNA
.

Recent
reports
demonstrated
that
ionizing
radiation
in
the
dose
range
of
2

50
Gy
results
in
expression
of
NF

kappa
B
in
human
KG

myeloid
leukemia
cells
and
human
B
-
lymphocyte
precursor
cells
;
the
precise
mechanism
involved
and
the
significance
are
not
yet
known
.

These
results
are
in
a
dose
range
where
the
viability
of
the
cells
remains
very
high
.

This
arrangement
of
Ets
sites
,
coupled
with
the
tissue
-
and
developmental
-
specific
expression
of
Ets
members
,
likely
play
a
key
role
in
defining
the
pattern
of
alpha

integrin
.

Lipopolysaccharide
induction
of
tissue
factor
gene
expression
in
monocytic
cells
is
mediated
by
binding
of
c

Rel
/
p65
heterodimers
to
a
kappa
B
-
like
site
.

Here
we
report
the
characterization
of
a
nuclear
complex
from
human
monocytic
cells
that
bound
to
a
kappa
B

site
,

'

CGGAGTTTCC
-

'
,
in
the
5
'
-
flanking
region
of
the
human
TF
gene
.

To
characterize
mechanisms
responsible
for
these
LIF
effects
,
levels
of
HIV
mRNA
,
activation
of
the
DNA
binding
protein
nuclear

(
NF

kB
,
signal
transduction
pathways
,
and
potential
interactions
with
other
cytokines
were
analyzed
.

The
Tat
-
mediated
increase
in
IL

2
promoter
activity
could
selectively
be
blocked
by
antisense
tat
or
-
unlike
the
analogous
effect
of
human
T
-
cell
lymphotropic
virus
type
1
Tax
-
by
cyclosporin
A
.

The
observed
increase
in
IL
-
2
levels
might
facilitate
virus
spread
from
or
to
T
cells
.

Purified
recombinant
Jun
and
Fos
proteins
failed
to
bind
directly
to
the
NFAT
motif
.

Positive
autoregulation
of
GR
expression
was
also
observed
in
glucocorticoid
-
resistant
CEM
-
C1
cells
,
which
contain
functional
GR
,
but
whose
growth
is
unaffected
by
glucocorticoids
.

The
stimulation
of
interleukin
-
1
alpha
production
by
okadaic
acid
was
more
modest
than
that
of
interleukin
-
1
beta
.

The
sequence
located
upstream
of
the
J
delta
1
segment
corresponded
to
the
previously
reported
germ
-
line
sequence
.

Finally
,
no
transcription
of
the
RAG
-
1
gene
could
be
detected
in
all
NK
cell
lines
or
clones
analyzed
.

However
,
the
tissue
specificity
of
this
promoter
is
only
partial
because
it
is
active
in
all
of
the
hematopoietic
cells
tested
here
,
regardless
of
whether
they
constitutively
express
Fc
epsilon
RI
-
gamma
chain
transcripts
.

Interleukin
-
3
(
IL
-
3
)
is
exclusively
expressed
by
activated
T
and
natural
killer
cells
,
a
function
that
is
tightly
controlled
both
in
a
lineage
-
specific
and
in
a
stimulation
-
dependent
manner
.

Over
its
3
'
end
,
it
binds
a
factor
that
is
ubiquitously
and
constitutively
expressed
.

These
characteristics
make
the
ACT
-
1
site
analogous
to
the
activating
ARRE
-
1
site
in
the
IL
-
2
promoter
.

A
dominant
inhibitory
ras
mutant
specifically
blocked
antigen
receptor
agonism
,
indicating
that
ras
activity
is
required
for
antigen
receptor
signaling
.

We
further
characterize
which
AP1
family
members
can
assume
this
role
.

To
further
evaluate
the
role
of
X
box
DNA
-
binding
proteins
in
class
II
gene
expression
,
the
role
of
the
X
box
region
was
examined
in
both
class
II
-
positive
and
-
negative
lymphoid
cells
.

In
contrast
to
wild
-
type
B
cells
,
neither
of
the
class
II
mutant
cell
lines
could
use
the
X
box
region
to
direct
the
expression
of
a
transiently
transfected
reporter
gene
,
indicating
that
the
X
box
-
dependent
transcriptional
pathway
is
defective
in
these
cells
.

One
of
the
essential
proteins
which
bound
to
the
enhancer
was
similar
or
identical
to
members
of
the
C
/
EBP
family
of
transcription
factors
required
for
both
IL

1
-
and
LPS
-
specific
induction
of
the
IL
-
6
gene
(
i

,
the
NF

)
.

The
divergent
effects
of
hemin
and
TPA
on
gene
expression
in
K562
cells
are
mediated
,
in
part
,
by
their
contrasting
effects
on
the
transcription
factor
NF
-
E2
.

Within
this
region
,
we
define
a
minimal

In

,
our

that
changes
in
the
composition
of
transcription
factor
AP

is
a
key
molecular
mechanism
for
increasing

may
underlie

Recent
studies
have
provided
new
insights
into
how
the

In

the

and
to
an

present
in
the

abnormal

To
ascertain
whether
the

,
we
transfected

The

and
23

respectively
)
,
indicating
that
the
increase
in
globin
mRNA
observed
in
UT

is
due
to
both
an
increase
of
gene
expression
per

and
an
increase
in

,
appears
to
stimulate
B29

through
a

.

Expression
of

Elevation

(

of
HIV

and
to
activate

.

Anti

TNF

but
not
anti

strongly
inhibited
both
the

transcription
and
the
induction
of
NF

by

These
results
indicate
that
Fc
gamma
R
can
mediate
a
TNF

alpha

dependent
induction
of
HIV
-

gene
transcription
and
suggest
that
immune
complexes
may
contribute
to
the
pathophysiology
of
HIV

infection
by
augmenting
viral
replication
in
monocytes
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
both

)
in
human

.

We
conclude
that
soluble
TNF

can
inhibit
stimuli

HIV
-
1

and
NK
-
kappa

DNA
-
binding
activity
in
chronically
infected
U1

This
may
explain
the
strong
cyto
-
differentiating
potential
of
AM580
in
PML
-
RAR
-
containing
leukemic
cells
.

This
pattern
of
distribution
is
,
thus
far
,
unique
to
the
GATA
transcription
factors
and
suggests
a
protein
-
protein
interaction
with
other
components
of
the
nuclear
bodies
via
the
GATA
zinc
finger
domain
.

This
resulted
in
concomitant
decrease
in
nuclear
NF
-
kappaB
DNA
-
binding
activity
and
endogenous
long
terminal
repeat
transcriptional
activity
.

Thus
,
changes
in
the
Sp1
binding
sites
had
the
most
dramatic
effects
on
SIVmac
replication
in
primary
macrophage
cultures
.

Consequently
,
IkappaBbeta
protein
expression
is
chronically
downregulated
in
HTLV

-
infected
T

.

Because
the
binding
site
showed
some
sequence
similarity
with
the
nuclear
factor
of

site
,
we
compared
the
kinetics
of
induction
of
the
two

complexes
and
the
molecular
masses
of
the
two
proteins
.

The

A

has
recently
been
elaborated

STAT1

,
STAT3

,
and
STAT5

were
present
in

Since
the

were
not
treated
with
cytokines
before
the
nuclear

were
extracted
,
we
conclude
that
these
factors
are
constitutively

was
induced

after

hours
and

,
respectively

The
effects
of
IFN

,
the

was
examined

While

was
shown
to
be
restricted
to

megakaryocytes

we
found
in
this
study
that
p45

is
abundantly

As
neutrophils
occupy
approximately
92
%
of
the
cells
in
this
fraction
,
the
cells
expressing
p45
is
most
likely
to
be
neutrophils
.

seen
in

These

suggest
that
the
action

tepoxalin
to
inhibit

in

may
be
at
least
in
part
due

its

is
increased
following

,
and
the

It
is
possible
that
the

,
particularly
those
in

Because

this

In

To

we
analyzed

These

despite
the
fact
that

By

,
these

were
not

In

In

the

requires
the

,
as
it

The

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
results
establish
that
PI
3
-
kinase
can
both
positively
and
negatively
regulate
T
-
cell
function
,
and
uncover
a
previously
unrecognized
function
for
PI
3
-
kinase
in
T
cells
as
a
selective
negative
regulator
of
TCR
-
signalling
events
and
therefore
as
a
determinant
of
T
-
cell
homeostasis
.

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
T
cell
tropic
strain
of
HIV
,
LAI
,
does
not
replicate
in
naive
CD4
T
cells
stimulated
by
cross
-
linking
CD3
and
CD28
.

The
suppression
of
productive
LAI
replication
in
naive
T
cells
is
not
due
to
differential
expression
of
viral
coreceptors
,
nor
is
it
due
to
inhibition
of
activation
of
the
important
HIV
transcription
factors
,
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
and
activator
protein
-

.

We
also
show
that
calcineurin
associated
with
the
N
-
terminal
domain
of
NFATx1
at
multiple
docking
sites
and
caused
a
reduction
of
size
,
indicative
of
dephosphorylation
,
in
NFATx1
.

Pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate
(
PDTC
)
is
an
inhibitor
of
NF
kappaB
in
most
cells
;
however
,
we
show
that
PDTC
is
also
a
potent
scavenger
of
NO
through
formation
of
mononitrosyl
iron
complexes
with
PDTC
.

In
astrocytes
PDTC
also
dramatically
induces
the
NF
kappaB
-
dependent
enzyme
,
iNOS
,
supporting
the
physiologic
relevance
of
endogenous
NO
regulation
of
NF
kappaB
.

The
effects
of
RA
on

was
determined
by
flow

on

.

Unexpectedly
,
the

subpopulation
failed
to
respond

was
used
to

of
MNDA
in
bone

as
well
as
in
other
paraffin

embedded
fixed
tissues
.

The
results
indicate
that
DNA
methylation
,
chromatin
structure
,
and
transactivation
at
an
Sp1
site
contribute
to
the
highly
restricted
expression
of
this
myelomonocytic
lineage
specific
gene
.

The

of
major

.

To
validate
the
method
,
we
made
use
of
earlier
receptor
binding
studies
indicating
that
normal
human
monocytes

One

To

is
crucial
for
the

whether
the

we
generated

Therefore
,

and
are
important

cooperate
as

One

motif
is
located
in
the
distal

at
the
nuclear

associated
Site
IV
,
and
the
second

is
present
in

at

.
Both

overlap
binding
sequences
for
the
multifunctional
YY1
transcription
factor
,
which
has
previously
been
shown
to
be
nuclear

.

Moreover
,
we
observed
constitutive
association
of
STAT3
with
each
STAT5
isomer
.

These
data
suggest
that
IL

2
and
IL

induce
assembly
of
STAT
heterodimers
in
a
similar
manner
and
that
subsequent
cellular

may
be
driven
by

of
similar
sets

As
shown
by

polymerase
chain
reaction
and

shift
assay
,
respectively
,
treatment
with

leads
to
decreased

and
reduced
activation
of
the
NF

transcription
factor
,
which
is
known
to
contribute
to
the
induction
of
the
TF

in

Surprisingly
,

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
ER
alpha
(
referred
to
throughout
as
ER
)
on
DNA
-
binding
activities
of
transcription
factors
involved
in
regulating
the
expression
of
erythroid
-
specific
genes
,
and
,
in
particular
,
the
histone
H5
gene
.

We
hypothesize
that
interference
in
DNA
-
binding
activities
of
GATA
-
1
and
CACCC
-
binding
proteins
is
the
mechanism
by
which
the
ER
inhibits
regulation
of
these
genes
.

The
binding
site
for
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
is
present
at
the
promoter
region
of
the
germline
Cepsilon
gene
,
but
there
is
little
information
on
whether
this
factor
is
involved
in
regulating
IgE
synthesis
by
human
B
cells
.

Of
note
,
CD40
-
mediated
enhancement
of
IL
-
4
-
driven
germline
Cepsilon
transcription
was
markedly
decreased
by
NAC
or
by
a
decoy
oligodeoxynucleotide
for
NF
-
kappaB
.

NAC
inhibited
the
generation
of
Smu
/
Sepsilon
switch
fragments
in
normal
human
B
cells
costimulated
with
IL
-
4
and
anti
-
CD40
monoclonal
antibody
.

These
results
suggest
that
coordination
of
NF
-
kappaB
and
STAT6
may
be
required
for
induction
of
germline
Cepsilon
transcription
by
IL
-
4
,
and
that
CD40
-
mediated
NF
-
kappaB
activation
may
be
important
in
regulating
both
enhancement
of
germline
Cepsilon
transcription
and
class
switching
to
IgE
.

RESULTS
:
After
nonspecific
stimulation
,
IL

production
by
CD4

T

from
both
atopic

was
significantly
enhanced
compared
with
that
by

from

In

both

shown
to

The

contained
RelA
,
and
exhibited
higher
affinity
towards
the
ICAM

than
to
the
HIV

site
.

These
data
show
that
the
detection
of
upregulated
p50
homodimers
in
LPS
tolerant
cells
is
dependent
on
subtle
differences
in
the
sequence
of
the
DNA
binding
motif
.

These
cells
,
stimulated
by
an
agonistic
monoclonal
antibody
against
CD40
or
by
transfection
with
a
CD40L
expression
vector
,
secreted
p40
and
showed
enhanced
p40
mRNA
expression
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
NF
-
kappaB
binding
site
located
around
120
bp
upstream
of
the
transcription
initiation
site
in
murine
and
human
p40
promoter
regions
could
be
important
for
the
p40
induction
by
CD40
ligation
via
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
.

Oxidants

,
and

In

,

resulted
in
the
induction
of
NF

,
but
had
no
apparent
effect
on
AP
-
1
-
binding
activity
.

Transient
expression
analyses
in
cells
of
neuroglial
and
lymphocytic
origin
demonstrated
that
some
of
these
LTRs
had
activities
which
varied
significantly
from
the
LAI
LTR
in
U

373

(
an
astrocytoma
cell
line
)
as
well
as
in
Jurkat
cells
(
a
CD4
-
positive

)
.

These
findings
suggest
that
LTR
sequence
changes
can
significantly
affect
basal
LTR
function
and
transcription
factor
recruitment
,
which
may
,
in
turn
,
alter
the
course
of
viral

in

are
both
involved
in
subsequent
steps
of
NF

.

Conversely
,
a

thus
suggesting
an

These

lead
to
a

model
for
the
synergistic
function
of

domains
in

and
OCA

B
(
mediated
by
the

action
of

and
,
further
,
suggest
a
functional
redundancy
in
general
coactivators
.

Ligand

these

demonstrate
that

in
the

that
is

An

been
postulated
to

suggesting
that

substitutes
for
the

This
observation
is
likely
to

the
findings
that

LMO
are
highly
synergistic
in

Promoter
analysis
revealed
that
a

and
sufficient
for
the

and
GATA3
binds
to
this

Because
this
region

is
involved
in
transcriptional

,
our
findings
suggest
the
possibility
that

may
be
transcriptionally

may
compete
with
Stat3alpha

Neither

Synergistic

We

Apoptosis

To

the

Possible

in
the
mechanism
(

of

of

compounds
.

In
this
paper
we
shall
advance
the
hypothesis
that
:
(
i
)
TNF

alpha
indirectly
controls
immune
surveillance
;
and
(
ii
)
TNF
-
alpha
controls
DNA
repair
and
tumor

through
the
regulation
of
wild
type
p53
.

Their
constitutive
expression
is
limited
to
B
lymphocytes
and
thymic
epithelial
cells
.

Thus
,
c

Fos
/
c

Jun
heterodimers
might
contribute
to
the
repression
of
DRA

expression
.

M

was
also
associated
with
a

of
the

,
although
expression
of
this
gene
was
prolonged
compared
to
that
of
c

jun
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
indicate
that
M
-
CSF
treatment
is
associated
with
differential
activation
of
multiple
members
of
the
jun
/
fos
family
and
that
expression
of
these

could
contribute
to
nuclear

mechanisms
that
regulate
a

The

activity
have
been
investigated
in
a

Stimulation
of
T

with
antigen
results
in
activation
of
several
kinases
,
including
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
,
that
may
mediate
the
later
induction
of

.

We
have
previously
shown
that
prolonged
treatment
of
the
untransformed

in

Dimerization
among
transcription
factors
has
become
a
recurrent
theme
in
the
regulation
of
eukaryotic
gene
expression
.

The
purified
homodimer
(
two
p50s
)
of
the
DNA
-
binding
subunit
of
NF
-
kappa
B
binds
the
B2
site
of
proenkephalin
relatively
better
than
does
the
heterotetramer
(
two
p65s
plus
two
p50s
)
form
of
the
factor
.

We
demonstrate
in
this
report
that
the
5
'
flanking
DNA
of
the
15
-
lox
gene
contains
sequences
which
down
-
regulate
its
activity
in
a
variety
of
non

erythroid
cell
lines
but
not
in
two
erythroid
cell
lines
.

The
element
has
characteristics
of
a
transcriptional
'
silencer
'
since
it
functions
in
both
orientations
.

This
requirement
has
been
attributed
to
the
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF
-
kappa
B
,
which
synergizes
with
the
constitutive
transcription
factor
Sp1
to
drive
the
HIV
-
1
promoter
.

T
cells
lack
active
NF

kappa
B
but
express
Sp1
as
expected
.

Protein
phosphorylation
has
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
of
these
two
factors
:
(
1
)
it
induces
the
transactivating
capacity
of
the
AP
-
1
protein
c
-
Jun
;
and
(

)
it
is
involved
in
the
release
of
the
cytoplasmic
inhibitor
,
I
kappa
B
,
from
NF
-
kappa
B
,
allowing
translocation
of
the
latter
into
the
nucleus
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
both
phosphorylation
processes
require
T
-
cell
costimulation
.

The

which
is
the

)
an

Moreover

When

In

High

To
elucidate
the

,
we
introduced
Tax1

BACKGROUND
:
Activated
platelets
tether
and
activate
myeloid
leukocytes
.

Our

suggest
that
leukocyte

platelet
adhesion
contributes
to
the
regulation
of

Regulation
by
Egr
-
1
,
c
-
Jun
,
and
NF
-
kappaB
transcription
factors
.

The
CRE
and
kappaB3
sites
in
region
II
together
conferred
strong
LPS
responsiveness
to
a
heterologous
promoter
,
whereas
individually
they
failed
to
provide
transcriptional
activation
.

These
studies
indicate
that
maximal
LPS
induction
of
the
TNF
-
alpha
promoter
is
mediated
by
concerted
participation
of
at
least
two
separate
cis
-
acting
regulatory
elements
.

Previous
reports
have
suggested
the
CD28
stimulation
contributes
to
the
activation
of
the
IL
-
2
promoter
by
up
-
regulating
the
activity
of
several
transcription
factors
,
including
AP
-
1
and
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
/
Rel
family
members
as
well
as
an
uncharacterized
transcription
factor
called
CD28
response
complex
.

Also
in
the
current
study
,
binding
activity
to
the
CD28RE
/
AP
-
1
sequence
of
the
IL
-
2
promoter
is
evaluated
.

These
data
indicate
that
functional
complexes
encompassing
both
the
CD28RE
and
the
AP
-
1
-
binding
sites
influence
IL
-
2
promoter
activity
in
CD28
-
costimulated
T
cells
.

The
Zfh
family
of
zinc
finger
/
homeodomain
proteins
was
first
identified
in
Drosophila
where
it
is
required
for
differentiation
of
tissues
such
as
the
central
nervous
system
and
muscle
.

Such
repression
imposes
a
requirement
for
both
c
-
Myb
and
Ets
for
transcriptional
activity
,
providing
one
explanation
for
why
synergy
between
these
factors
is
important
.

In
DNA
-
protein
binding
studies
,
we
detected
the
binding
of
transcription
factors
GABP
alpha
and
-
beta
to
a
dyad
symmetry
element
(
DSE
)
of
the
distal
enhancer
,
which
is
formed
by
palindromic
binding
sites
of
Ets
-
like
factors
.

Depletion
of
intracellular
TRAF2
and
its
coassociated
proteins
also
increased
the
sensitivity
of
the
cell
to
undergoing
apoptosis
during
activation
of
death
-
inducing
receptors
such
as
TNFR1
.

Recently
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
DSE
are
also
cAMP
-
responsive
elements
(
CRE
)
,
since
they
mediated
activation
signals
elicited
by
cholera
toxin
(
Ctx
)
,
a
potent
activator
of
the
cAMP
-
dependent
protein
kinase
A
(
PKA
)

The
Epstein

latent

(

is
essential
for
the

The

on

were
constant
and
consistent
with
those
in
other
tissues
.

Extinction
of
immunoglobulin
gene
expression
in
B
cells
upon
fusion
with
HeLa
cells
is
preceded
by
rapid
nuclear
depletion
of
essential
transcription
factors
and
is
accompanied
by
widespread
inactivation
of
genes
expressed
in
a
B
cell

specific
manner
.

When
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
expressing
B
cells
are
fused
with
non
-
B
cells
,
Ig
expression
is
rapidly
suppressed
at
the
level
of
transcription
,
a
phenomenon
termed
extinction
.

We
now
show
that
this
differential
rescue
by
specific
cytokines
in
Th
cells
correlates
with
the
level
of
IkappaBalpha
that
is
regulated
by
DEX
and
cytokines
.

Adherent

At

in

.

Treatment
of

with

reduced
leukocyte

in
respect
to

Electrophoretic

assays
revealed
that
recombinant
IL

2
increased
NF

kappaB
binding
activity
in
nuclear
extracts
of
the
leukemia
cells
,
and
Northern

analysis
showed
that
IL
-
2
increased
the
abundance
of
mRNAs
encoding
the
NF

kappaB
components
c

Rel
and
KBF1
in
these

in

.

It
was
concluded
that
even
when
LMP1
is
unable
to
activate
NF

kappaB
,
it
is
still
capable
of
inducing
certain
characteristics
of

,
strongly
suggesting
that
LMP1
can
also
activate
cells
independently
of

Induction

of

is
a
physiological
process
for

TNF

of
the

Furthermore
,
the

led
to
a

the

BACKGROUND
:
We
reported
on
the
constitutive
interferon

.

The
results
therefore
provide
initial
evidence
linking
abnormal
behavior
of
STAT
pathways
for
cytokine
signaling
to
the
development
of
an
inflammatory

.

.

HLA
class
I
-
mediated
inactivation
of
Rb
can
be
inhibited
specifically
by
neutralizing
Abs
to
basic
fibroblast

(
bFGF
)
,
suggesting
a
role
for
FGF
receptors
in
the
signaling

.

The
molecular
basis
of
GC
insensitivity
is
unknown
.

Alternative
splicing
of
the
GC

(

)
pre

mRNA
generates
a
second
GCR
,
termed
GCRbeta
,
which
does
not
bind
GC
but
antagonizes
the
transactivating
activity
of
the
classic
GCR
.

We
conclude
that
GC
-
insensitive
asthma
is
associated
with
increased
expression
of
GCRbeta
in
airway
T

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
data
indicate
that
the
lack

features
in
patients
with

is
not
ascribable
to
a
reduced
sensitivity
to

but
is
more
likely
due
to
the
paucity

Furthermore

were

in
cellular

Janus

is
a

Genetic

is
manifested
as
severe

in

Here
we
provide

that

After

activates
a

Recent
studies
suggest
that
one
or
more
cytoplasmic
serine
kinases
also
phosphorylate
STAT3
and
are
necessary
for
maximal
gene
activation
.

However
,
disruption
of
a

rich
sequence
motif
(

)
in
either
subunit
of
the
bipartite
IL

4R
abolished
not
only
ligand
-
induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
Janus
kinases
JAK1
and
JAK3
,
but
also
IL
-

-
triggered
activation
of
STAT5
and
concomitant
cell
proliferation
.

However
,
a
minority
of
genes
are
semi
-
dominant
,
as
heterozygous
loss
-
of
-
function
mutation
in
these
genes
leads
to
phenotypic
abnormalities
.

The
allele
-
specific
regulation
of
Pax5
raises
the
intriguing
possibility
that
monoallelic
expression
may
also
be
the
mechanism
causing
the
haploinsufficiency
of
other
Pax
genes
.

It
has
been
demonstrated
that
interferon

gamma
(
IFN

)
and
interleukin

(

)
have
various
reverse

on
macrophages
;
however
,
the
molecular
mechanism
of
this
difference
has
not
been
fully
understood
.

This
finding
indicates
that

Although

A
major

The

this
activity
was
designated
Oct
coactivator
from
B
cells
(
OCA

)
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
suggest
that
OCA

B
is
a
tissue
-
,
promoter
-
,
and
factor

specific
coactivator
and
that
OCA

may
be
a
major

for

Since

,
the
consistency
of
translocations
near
the

was
further
examined
.

We
show
that
both

are
expressed
in
many

In

,
we

These

suggest
that
BCL6
plays
a
role
in

.

The
survival

of
the

appears
to
be
modulated
by
interactions
between
various

Kinetic

indicated
that

The

were
identical
to
those

could
be
identified
as

.

Only

From
these

,
we
conclude
that
CD38
is
ATRA
inducible
in
myeloid
leukemia
cells
and
normal
CD34

bone
marrow
cells
.

This
effect
is
independent
of
differentiation
and
is
mediated
by
RAR
alpha
in
HL

cells
,
suggesting
a
similar
role
for
RAR
alpha
in
CD38
expression
in
other
hematopoietic
cells
.

Their
effects
on
the

were
different
:
hck

was
similarly

was
stronger
and
more

However
,
all

Our
studies
suggest
that
this
form
of

may
arise
from

of
a

at

,
to
redox

.

This

(

were
found
to
have

Addition

The

of
several
cytoskeleton

increased
as
determined
by

.

These
included
vimentin

These
findings
suggest
a
mechanism
by
which
IL

to
its

may
activate

involved
in

.

Treatment
of

.

DESIGN
:
The
effects
of
hypercortisolaemia
,
hyperthermia
and
cellular
composition
on
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
per
cell
and
their

were
evaluated
,
both
in

and
in

,
in
peripheral

mononuclear
leucocytes
of
control
subjects
and
in
patients
with

or

.

SUBJECTS
:
Fifteen
patients
(
age
25
-
79
)
with
sepsis
or
septic
shock
who
were
admitted
to
an
intensive
care
unit
were
studied
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
The
binding
capacity
and
affinity
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
were
measured
and
compared
to
clinical
data
and
the
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
.

Inasmuch
as
these
features
implicate
enhanced
calcitriol
action
in
gut
and
bone
,
we
analyzed
the
vitamin
D
receptor
(
VDR
)
gene
to
ascertain
whether
an
abnormality
of
this
gene
marks
patients
with
intestinal
hyperabsorption
of
calcium
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
human
GM
-
CSF
receptor
alpha
promoter
directs
reporter
gene
activity
in
a
tissue
-
specific
fashion
in
myelomonocytic
cells
,
which
correlates
with
its
expression
pattern
as
analyzed
by
reverse
transcription
PCR
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
PU
-
SF
complex
binds
to
PU
.
1
sites
found
on
a
number
of
myeloid
promoters
,
and
its
formation
requires
an

adjacent
to
a
single

region
.

However
,
the
difference
of

Our
results
contradict
the
hypothesis
concerning
the
possible
role
of
nm23
gene
as
a
metastatic

gene
in
human
skin
cancer
.

As
expected
,
the
TCF

protein
was
detectable
only
in
cell
lines
of
T
lineage
.

Its
expression
was
always
restricted
to
the
nucleus
.

Upon
cellular
activation
,
expression
of
the
L
-
selectin
gene
is
downregulated
at
both
the
protein
and
mRNA
levels
.

These
results
indicated
that
ATL
cells
constitutively
overexpress
the
L

selectin
gene
that
can
be
transactivated
by
HTLV

In
one

a

lead
to
the

Using
varying
conditions
,
three
distinct
complexes
were
shown
to
interact
specifically
with
the
NIP
region
,
although
only
one
correlates
with
repressor

.

Complex

corresponds
to

of

an
E

Jak

was
tyrosine
phosphorylated
within
1
to
3
min
after
stimulation
of
eosinophils
with
IL

.

Our
results
suggest
that
a
similar
phenomenon
may
occur
in
BL
in
vivo
and
indicate
that
the
operational
definition
of
EBV
latencies
is
not
easily
applied
to
human
tumors
.

The
interleukin

interaction
activates
Lyn
and
Jak2
tyrosine
kinases
and
propagates
signals
via
the
Ras
-
Raf

1
-
MAP
kinase
and
the
Jak
-
STAT
pathways
in
eosinophils
.

We
found
that
IL

5
induces
two
GAS
-
binding
proteins
in
eosinophils
,
one
of
which
is
STAT1
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
point
to
a
potential
mechanism
underlying
EBV

transformation
whereby
constitutive
induction
of

lead
to

.

We
have
recently
demonstrated
that
stimulation
of
human
T
and
natural
killer
cells
with
IL
-
12
induces
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
the
Janus
family
tyrosine

JAK2
and
Tyk2
,
implicating
these
kinases
in
the
immediate
biochemical
response
to

We
previously
have
demonstrated
a
requirement
for
oxidative
events
during

entry
in
T

and
have
hypothesised
that
reactive
oxygen
species
may
act
as
intracellular
signalling
agents
during
lymphocyte
activation
.

This
inhibitory
effect
was
limited
to
the

stimulated

They
also
provided

for
the
hypothesis
that

that
is
responsible
for

We
hypothesize
that

helps
govern
the

Erythropoietin

Since
the
terminal
events
of
erythropoiesis
are
controlled
by
the
glycoprotein
hormone
erythropoietin
(
Epo
)
,
we
investigated
whether
the

were
affected
by

in

The

indicating
that

not
with
its

Inhibition

In
studies
initiated
to

to
5
days
after

of
purified

;
the
induced

transcriptionally
active
.

This
inhibition
of
transcription
is
specific
for

in
the

,

The
ATRA

of

,
an

,
may
be
one
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
of

induced
growth
inhibition
,
and
the
basis
for
the
synergistic
actions
of
ATRA
and
IFNs
in
myeloid
leukemia
cells
.

The
inhibiting
effect
of
IL
-
4
was
slightly
more
pronounced
than
that
of
IL
-
10
.

NF
-
IL6
mRNA
levels
were
not
affected
by
IL
-
10
or
IL
-
4
,
suggesting
that
IL
-
4
affects
binding
activity
of
preexisting
NF
-
IL6
.

Furthermore
,
neither
IL

10
nor
IL
-
4
showed
any
effect
on
I
-
kappa
B
mRNA
expression
as
determined
by
Northern

.

To
examine
the
molecular
basis
of
constitutive
NF
-
kappaB
DNA
-
binding
activity
in
HIV1
-
infected
cells
,
we
analyzed
the
phosphorylation
and
turnover
of
IkappaBalpha
protein
,
the
activity
of
the
double
-
stranded
RNA
-

protein
kinase
(

)
and
the
intracellular
levels
of
NF
-
kappaB
subunits
in
the
PLB
-
985
and
U937
myeloid
cell
models
.

These
results
suggest
that
IL
-
4
may
inhibit
the
transcription
of
the
IL
-
6
gene
by
affecting
NF
-
kappaB
binding
activity
,
while
IL
-
10
may
inhibit
the
IL
-
6
mRNA
levels
post
-
transcriptionally
,
without
suppressing
promoter
activity
.

Therefore
,
we
have
studied
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule
-
1
(
ICAM
-

)
as
adhesion
molecules
are
likely
to
play
a
causal
role
in
inflammation
in
promoting
cell
-
cell
and
cell
-
matrix
interactions
.

Our
data
support
the
notion
that
NF
(
kappa
)
B
and
I
(
kappa
)
B
proteases
play
obligate
roles
in
T
cell
activation
and
mitogenesis
,
roles
that
are
enhanced
significantly
by
NAC
.

Rather
,
tyrosine
phosphorylation
was
shown
to
be
directly
involved
in
mediating
CD40

signals
.

These
observations
establish
the
importance
of
different
signal
transducing
pathways
leading
to
CD40
activation
of
B
lymphocytes
.

These
findings
indicate
that
T
cells
representing
different
activation
and

or
differentiation
stages
can
be
differentially
responsive
to
ROI

nuclear

of
Rel

nuclear

(

factors
in

.

Since
LPS
and
anti

were
unable
to
activate
RelB
,
CD40
appears
to
trigger
a
special
program
of
gene
expression
involved
in
the
proliferation
and
/

differentiation
of
B
lymphocytes

was

that
in

suggested
that

The

The

(

)
,
another

of
the

with
functions
in
cellular
signal
transmission
,
also
undergoes
sequential
proteolytic
processing
,
resulting
in
intracellular

into
the

.

The

also
involves

Inactivation

We
suggest
that
histone
H3
modification
at
lysine

directly
regulates
chromatin
condensation
by
recruiting
MENT
to
chromatin
in
a
fashion
that
is
spatially
constrained
from
active
genes
by
gene
boundary
elements
and
histone
hyperacetylation
.

Using
conditional

,
we
find
that
loss
of
Neo1p
function
causes
cargo

specific
defects
in

protein
transport
early
in
the
secretory
pathway
and
perturbs

in

Herein
,
we

the
role
of
histone

on
the

process
by
inhibiting
histone
deacetylases
shortly
before

in
human
primary

.

Inhibition
of

before

produced
defective
chromosome

and
impaired
mitotic

in
living

,
suggesting
that
improper
chromosome

may
induce

)
,
were
found
to
be
capable
of
inducing

.

Digestion
by

significantly
decreased
the

CONCLUSION
:
The
Pro582Ser

represents
a
common

of

that
does
not
impair

.

In

,
the

Surprisingly
,

,
and

,
were
significantly
reduced
in
PARP

1
-
/
-
cells
,
as
compared
with
PARP

.

These
results
suggest
that
PARP

1
is
required
for
the
proper
expression
of
particular
HATs
.

Since
p300
and
CBP
are
coactivators
of
NF

kappaB
,
we
propose
here
that
PARP

1
participates
in
NF

kappaB

transcription
by
means
of
maintaining
the
expression
of
HATs

The

.

Epigenetic
switch
from
posttranscriptional

is
correlated
with

hypermethylation
.

The
results
suggest
that
a
switch
between
posttranscriptional
and
transcriptional
gene
silencing
could
be
a
mechanism
leading
to
irrevocable
shut
down
of
gene
expression
within
a
finite

.

The

,
both
at

and
at
the

These

prompted
us
to

Likewise
,
deletion

Here
,
we
create

the

and
their
role
in

to
be
investigated
.

Our

highlight
the
striking
divergence
between
the
histone

for
the

CONCLUSION
:
The

shifted
towards

is
a

in

To
determine
the
implication
of
aberrant
methylation
,
one
of
the
most
frequent
mechanisms
of
silencing
the
tumor
suppressor
or
cancer

,
we
examined
the
methylation
status
of
DLC
-
1
promoter
region
in
breast
cancer
cell
lines
and
primary
breast
tumors
.

These
data
suggest
that
hypermethylation
is
responsible
for
silencing
of
DLC

gene
in
a
limited
portion
of
breast
cancers
.

Neutralizing
antibody
titers
have
been
correlated
with

following

against
many

.

However
,
the
potency
and
titers
of
neutralizing
antibodies
that
arise
during
HIV
infection
are
generally
discouragingly
low
and
the
antibodies
that
do
arise
recognize
mainly
autologous

.

The

detected
hypermethylation
of

(

,
E

patients
(

)
,
and

in

)
.

The

were
37

40
,
and
75
%
in
stages
I

,
and

,
respectively
.

Neither

took
place
also
in
the
presence
of

and
gave
a
smaller
yet
significant

.

Interestingly
,
we
have
found
a
similar
stimulatory
effect
of
S

adenosylhomocysteine
(
SAH
)
,
the
methylation
product
of
SAM
,
on

A

in
the
cytosolic

of
Clostridium

and
is
required
for

.

The
binding
of
LT
(
cyt
)
to
phosphatidylserine
increases
by
two
orders
of
magnitude
the
rate
of
glucosylation
of

.

The

substitutions
are
also
found
to
increase

in
the
absence
of
any
sugar
derivatives
,
where
a
mechanism
based
on
prevention
of
glycation
can
no
longer
be
invoked
.

The

of

is
rationalized
on
the
basis
of
a

remains
obscure
.

Rad6
-
mediated
ubiquitylation
of

H2B
at
lysine
123
has
been
linked
to
transcriptional
activation
and
the
regulation
of
lysine
methylation
on
histone
H3
.

This
fact
suggests
that
Rad6
is
recruited
to
promoters
independently
of
the
Paf1
complex

then
requires
this
complex
for
entrance
into
the

So
far
,
because

of

,
transfecting

has
not

plays
a
central
role
in
regulating
transcriptional

.

The

would
provide
a
convenient
way
of
probing
the
biochemical
properties
of
the

and

,
and
of

as

We
have
analysed
the

of
the
human

,
particularly
the

of

.

The

alters
the

to
enhance
its

.

RESULTS
:
The
significant
enhanced
expression
of
the
fibrinogen

and
reduced

of

were
demonstrated
in
the
profiles
of
untreated

patients
using
both
silver

and

methods
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Plasma

untreated
CH

demonstrated
different
altered
expression
of
fibrinogen
and
haptoglobin
polypeptide
chains
,
which
was
normalized
when
patients
were
treated
.

Collectively
,
these

In
this

we
aimed
at
generating

whose
PSGs
are
capable
of
producing
mini

collagens
and
enough
P4H
for
their

.

The

in
the

was
130

higher
than
that
of
wild

.

A

containing

was

,
among
which

in

.

In

to
the

the

that
were
responsible
for

the

The

of
the

in
the
two

was
identical
.

It
is
likely
that
the
two

were
evolved
from
the

and
adapted
later
to

In
this
study
,
LAQ824
mediated
apoptosis
was
found
to
occur
mainly
via
activation
of
the
mitochondrial
death
pathway
by
inducing
Apaf1
and
caspase
9
and
promoting
mitochondrial
release
of
key
proapoptotic
factors
in
lung
cancer
cells
,
but
not
in
normal
fibroblast
cells
.

In
addition
,
LAQ824
was
found
to
induce
Bax
translocation
in
lung
cancer
cell
,
which
may
play
important
role
in
the
induction
of
the
release
of
mitochondrial
proapoptotic
factors
.

Here
,
we
identify
the
requirements
for
such
selective
targeting
.

Consequently
,
PHD3
is
found
in
high

molecular

mass
fractions
that
were
enriched
in
hypoxia
.

Interestingly
,
within
the
lower
-
molecular
-
mass
complex
,
PHD3
exhibits
higher
specific
activity
towards
hydroxylation
of
HIF
-
1alpha
and
co
-
localizes
with
Siah2
,
suggesting
that
Siah2
limits
the
availability
of
the
more
active
form
of
PHD3
.

Studies
on
hypoxia

pathways
have
revealed
a
series
of

that

by

.

Nevertheless
,
development
of
pharmaceutical
agents
to
control
PRMT
functions
could
lead
to
significant
new
targets
.

The
cold
and
menthol
receptor
TRPM8
contains
a
functionally
important
double
cysteine
motif
.

To
do
this
,
amino
-
terminal
c
-
myc
or
hemagglutinin
epitope
-
tagged
proteins
were
incorporated
and
expressed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
.

Finally
,
we
showed
in
Perfluoro
-
octanoic
acid
-
polyacrylamide
gels
that
TRPM8
can
form
a
tetramer
(
in
addition
to
dimer
and
trimer
forms
)
,
consistent
with
current
thinking
that
functional
TRP
ion
channels
are
tetrameric
.

These
data
indicate
that
Foxp3
may
regulate
transcription
through
direct
chromatin
remodeling
and
show
that
Foxp3
function
is
influenced
by
signals
from
the
TCR
.

Recently
,
an

has

to
some
urine

(
denominated

by
the

Doping
Agency
;

)
.

Consequently
,
to
understand
whether
spatial
relationships
that
are
not
coincident
are
nonrandom
and
potentially
biologically
important
,
it
is
necessary
to
develop
statistical
approaches
.

Real

of

.

In

the

of

Furthermore
,
the
potential
glycosylation
site
at

is
glycosylated
only
if
all
five
natural

are
simultaneously
mutated
.

Our
previous
studies
demonstrated
that
inhibition
of
histone

(
HDACs
)
by
trichostatin
A
reactivates
estrogen

(

)
gene

in

The
biological

of
the

were

that
of
the

(

produced

was

6
%
higher
than

These

demonstrate
that
tPA
produced
in
urea

have
a
very
high
biological
activity
and
the

is

The

.

These
results
strongly
support
an

for

In
the

,
correlation
between
the

thus

is
a

Consistent
with
the
genetic

interactions
linking
CCR4

with

we
find
that

we
show
that

Overexpression
of

led
to
the
identification
of
a

(

)
that
increased

of

of
the
PHDs
in
the
light
of
crystal
structures
for
PHD2
,
and
results
for
other

,
suggested
that
either
the
C

terminal
region
or
a
loop
linking
two
beta

strands
(
beta2
and
beta3
in
human

are
important
in
determining
substrate

.

In
this
study
,
we
present
a
combined
proteomics
and
genomics
study
of
SMYD2
designed
to
elucidate
its
molecular
roles
.

In
particular
,
we
report
that
SMYD2
interacted
with
HSP90alpha
independently
of
the
SET
and
MYND
domains
,
with
EBP41L3
through
the
MYND

,
and
with

through
the

.

TACC2
is
one
of
the
genes
up

as
a

Indeed
,
the

the

a
crucial

in
the

of

adopts
two

measured
in

.

The
relationship
between
the
dose
of
apomorphine
and
Dopa

in
the
neocortex
appeared
biphasic
,
the
highest
dose
(
3
.
2
mg
/
kg
)
having
no
significant
effect
.

A
similar
trend
was
observed
for
clonidine
.

The
basal
importance
of
dopamine
neurones
for
the
locomotor
function
studied
in
the
present
paper
is
illustrated
by
the
marked
inhibition
by
low
doses
of
apomorphine
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
observations
with
clonidine
suggest
a
somewhat
less
striking
and
perhaps
less
direct
influence
of
noradrenaline
neurones
on
motor
activity
.

PURPOSE
:
Our
preclinical
experiments
indicated
that
Romidepsin
(
Depsipeptide
FK228
;
DP
)
mediates
growth
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
cultured
lung
cancer
cells
.

A
variety
of
molecular
end
points
were
assessed
in
tumor
biopsies
via
immunohistochemistry
techniques
.

RESULTS
:
Nineteen
patients
were
evaluable
for
toxicity
assessment
;
18
were
evaluable
for
treatment
response
.

Transient
stabilization
of

was
noted
in
nine
patients
.

Interleukin
1
(
IL
-
1
)
has
been
reported
to
stimulate
the
polyubiquitination
and
disappearance
of
IL
-
1
receptor
-
associated
kinase
1
(
IRAK1
)
within
minutes
.

It
has
been
thought
that
the
polyubiquitin
chains
attached
to
IRAK1
are
linked
via
Lys48
of
ubiquitin
,
leading
to
its
destruction
by
the
proteasome
and
explaining
the
rapid
IL
-
1
-
induced
disappearance
of
IRAK1
.

In
mammalian
cells
,
ERAD
can
be
blocked
by
a
chemical
inhibitor
termed
Eeyarestatin
I
,
but
the
mechanism
of
EerI
action
is
unclear
.

A
pathological
hallmark
of
these
childhood
neurodegenerative
diseases
is
the
presence
of
distinctive
spheroids
in
distal
axons
that
contain
accumulated
membranes
.

In
contrast
to
Nrf2
ProTalpha
was
not
subjected
to
Keap
-
dependent
ubiquitination
,
degradation
and
export
from
the
nucleus
.

We
found
that
a
large
number
of
peptides
can
be
modified
on
the
lysine
,
arginine
,
histidine
,
and
glutamic
acid
residues
with
a
mass
increase
of
14
or
28
Da
,
consistent
with
methylation
.

These
results
suggest
the
possibility
of
either
exogenous
protein
methylation
during
sample
handling
and
processing
for
mass
spectrometry
or
the
existence
of
SAM
-
independent
pathways
for
protein
methylation
.

Exposure
to
the
prolonged
cold
of
winter
is
required
to
permit
awakening
from
diapause
in
the
spring
.

There
is
an
additional
short
N
-
terminal
region
that
is
capable
of
binding
one
more
copper
ion
,
suggesting
a
timer
mechanism
in
which
this
ion
is
involved
.

Previous
work
from
our
laboratory
has
established
the
role
of
Grb10
as
a
negative
regulator
of
IGF
-
IR
-
dependent
cell
proliferation
.

We
have
shown
that
Grb10
binds
the
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
Nedd4
and
promotes
IGF
-
I
-
stimulated
ubiquitination
,
internalization
,
and
degradation
of
the
IGF
-
IR
,
thereby
giving
rise
to
long
-
term
attenuation
of
signaling
.

These
results
indicate
that
Grb10
and
Nedd4
play
a
critical
role
in
mediating
IGF
-
IR
down
-
regulation
by
promoting
ligand
-
dependent
multiubiquitination
of
the
IGF
-
IR
,
which
is
required
for
receptor
internalization
and
regulates
mitogenesis
.

Many
viruses
modulate
the
ubiquitin
(
Ub
)
pathway
to
alter
cellular
signaling
and
the
antiviral
response
.

Furthermore
,
overexpression
of
ISG15
diminished
the
ability
of
Nedd4
to
ubiquitinate
viral
matrix
proteins
and
led
to
a
decrease
in
the
release
of
Ebola
VP40
virus
-
like
particles
from
the
cells
.

We
previously
proposed
that
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
CRY
regulates
light
responses
is
via
its
physical
interaction
with
COP1
,
a
RING
motif
-
containing
E3
ligase
.

TDP
-
43
-
DeltaNLS
accumulates
as
insoluble
cytoplasmic
aggregates
and
sequesters
endogenous
TDP
-
43
,
thereby
depleting
normal
nuclear
TDP
-
43
,
whereas
TDP
-
43
-
DeltaNES
forms
insoluble
nuclear
aggregates
with
endogenous
TDP
-
43
.

Mutant
forms
of
TDP
-
43
also
replicate
the
biochemical
profile
of
pathological
TDP
-
43
in
FTLD
-
U
/
ALS
.

We
have
tested
this
idea
and
found
it
to
be
true
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Here
we
show
that
S
.
pneumoniae
activates
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
signaling
pathway
and
the
subsequent
up
-
regulation
of
inflammatory
mediators
via
a
key
pneumococcal
virulence
factor
,
pneumolysin
.

Our
studies
thus
bring
new
insights
into
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
S
.
pneumoniae
infections
through
the
NFAT
-
dependent
mechanism
and
further
identify
CYLD
as
a
negative
regulator
for
NFAT
signaling
,
thereby
opening
up
new
therapeutic
targets
for
these
diseases
.

RESULTS
:
Herein
we
describe
a
yeast
three
-
hybrid
system
that
reconstitutes
mammalian
HIF
regulation
by
the
EGLNs
and
VHL
.

This
is
the
first
report
of
the
essential
role
of
SPOP
in
ERalpha
ubiquitination
by
the
Cullin3
-
based
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
complex
.

We
also
demonstrated
repression
of
the
transactivation
capability
of
ER
alpha
;
in
cultured
mammalian
cells
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
UBA
domains
are
involved
in
binding
two
different
polyubiquitin
isoforms
,
linear
and
K48
-
linked
.

These
data
establish
EZH2
-
mediated
H3K27triM
as
a
mechanism
of
tumor
-
suppressor
gene
silencing
in
cancer
that
is
potentially
independent
of
promoter
DNA
methylation
.

We
conclude
that
many
mitotic
divisions
are
unequal
,
unlike
what
was
previously
thought
.

Here
we
show
that
small
HERC
proteins
interact
with
each
other
and
localize
to
the
same
cellular
structures
,
which
we
identify
as
late
endosomes
and
lysosomes
.

They
play
important
roles
in
maintaining
stem
cell
pluripotency
and
in
cancer
pathogenesis
.

Carbohydrate

is
known
to
modulate
the
activity
of

in
the

,
in
which

particularly
affects

.

Whole

ADCC
assays
,
containing
both
types
of

,
revealed
little
differences
in
tumor
cell
killing
between
both

.

The
rpS2
(
100

amino
acids
)
domain
,
but
not
the
amino
-
terminus
of
rpS2
that
includes
the
RG
repeat
region
was
essential
for
binding
to
PRMT3
and
was
susceptible
to
degradation
.

The
ubiquitin
-
protein
ligase
Nedd4
-
2
differentially
interacts
with
and
regulates
members
of
the
Tweety
family
of
chloride
ion
channels
.

Structurally
,
Tweety
proteins
are
characterized
by
five
membrane
-
spanning
domains
and
N
-
glycan
modifications
important
for
trafficking
to
the
plasma
membrane
,
where
these
proteins
are
oriented
with
the
amino
terminus
located
extracellularly
and
the
carboxyl
terminus
cytoplasmically
.

These
related
proteins
can
suppress
silencing
by
multiple
mechanisms
,
one
of
which
involves
interacting
with
and
inhibiting
adenosine
kinase
(
ADK
)
,
a
cellular
enzyme
associated
with
the
methyl
cycle
that
generates
S
-
adenosyl
-
methionine
,
an
essential
methyltransferase
cofactor
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrate
that
Beet
curly
top
virus
L2
-
mutant
DNA
present
in
tissues
that
have
recovered
from
infection
is
hypermethylated
and
that
host
recovery
requires
AGO4
,
a
component
of
the
RNA
-
directed
methylation
pathway
.

To
assess
the
medulloblastoma
epigenome
more
comprehensively
,
we
undertook
a
genomewide
investigation
to
identify
genes
that
display
evidence
of
methylation
-
dependent
regulation
.

These
data
reveal
a
more
diverse
and
expansive
medulloblastoma
epi
genome
than
previously
understood
and
provide
strong
evidence
that
the
methylation
status
of
specific
genes
may
contribute
to
the
biological
subclassification
of
medulloblastoma
.

Moreover
,
Hltf
-
deficient
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
show
elevated
chromosome
breaks
and
fusions
after
methyl
methane
sulfonate
treatment
.

Mutating
the
highly
conserved
N
terminus
increases
substrate
ubiquitination
and
the
number
of
substrate
lysines
targeted
,
allows
ubiquitination
of
APC
substrates
lacking
their
destruction
boxes
,
increases
resistance
to
the
APC
inhibitors
Emi1
and
BubR1
in

,
and
bypasses
the
spindle
checkpoint
in
vivo
.

Amplification
of
Nat1
and
Nat2
from
A
/
J
(
A
)
mouse
(
slow
acetylator
)
genomic
DNA
by
the
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
subsequent
sequencing
revealed
that
Nat1
was
identical
in
B6
and
A
mice
,
whereas
Nat2
contained
a
single
nucleotide
change
from
adenine
in
B6
to
thymine
in
A
mice
.

Here
,
we
report
that
UT
-
A1
is
ubiquitinated
and
degraded
by
the
proteasome
but
not
the
lysosome
proteolytic
pathway
.

MDM2
mediates
UT
-
A1
ubiquitination
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

The
mechanism
is
likely
to
be
physiologically
important
as
UT
-
A1
ubiquitination
was
identified
in
kidney
inner
medullary
tissue
.

Although
ubiquitination
of
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
(
PCNA
)
is
not
required
for
the
localization
of
poleta
in
foci
,
it
results
in
an
increased
residence
time
in
foci
.
poliota
is
even
more
mobile
than
poleta
,
both
when
uniformly
distributed
and
when
localized
in
foci
.

We
and
others
have
shown
that
this
transporter
undergoes
endocytosis
and
degradation
in
response
to
activation
of
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
,
however
,
the
mechanisms
involved
remain
unclear
.

Mutation
of
all
11
lysine
residues
in
the
amino
and
carboxyl
-
terminal
domains
to
arginine
(
11R
)
abolished
this
signal
.

Together
these
data
define
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
the
predominant
forebrain
glutamate
transporter
can
be
rapidly
targeted
for
degradation
.

Both

,
as
shown
by
low

EPR
.

Linkage
analysis
revealed
that
the
galactosyl
component
was
in
the
furanoic
conformation
,
which
was
attaching
in
a
terminal

.

Prolyl

)
through

hydroxylation
,
earmarking
HIFalpha
for

.

Under

,
HIF
stabilization
leads
to
enhanced
transcription
and

of
a

of
processes
,
including
erythropoiesis
.

and

(

to

)
.

By
contrast
,
single
ubc1
,
ubc2
,
or
ubc3
mutants
show
no
flowering
defect
;
only
ubc1
ubc2
double

,
and
not

with

,
show

.

In
the
light
of
the
important
role
that
YB
-
1
appears
to
play
in
tumourigenesis
,
our
results
suggest
that
RBBP6
may
be
a
relevant
target
for
therapeutic
drugs
aimed
at
modifying
the
activity
of
YB
-
1
.

This
contention
was
corroborated
by
synthesizing
a
tridecapeptide
corresponding
to
residues
26
-
38
of
avidin
;
this
peptide
was
shown
to
recognize
biotin
.

The
approach
taken
in

enabled
the

Complex

In
this

,
a
heptad

was
randomized
with

to
uncover

promoting
transmembrane

interactions
.

Reconstruction
of

confirmed
that

CONCLUSIONS
/
SIGNIFICANCE
:
Our
results
show
that
aggregation
of
MYOC
in
the
endoplasmic

activates
the
UPR
,
an
evolutionarily
conserved
stress
pathway
that
culminates
in
apoptosis

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
Congenital
lactase
deficiency
(
CLD
)
is
a
cause
of
disaccharide
intolerance
and
malabsorption
characterized
by
watery
diarrhea
in
infants
fed
breast
milk
or
lactose
-
containing
formulas
.

METHODS
:
We
introduced
a
mutation
into
the
LPH
complementary
DNA
that
resulted
in
the
amino
acid
substitution
G1363S
.

RESULTS
:
The
mutant
protein
LPH
-
G1363S
was
misfolded
and
could
not
exit
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

The
intracellular
transport
and
enzymatic
activity
,
but
not
correct
folding
,
of
LPH
-
G1363S
were
partially
restored
by
expression
at
20
degrees
C
.

Thus
,
we
propose
that
ubiquitinated
Tau
inclusions
arise
due
to

Thus
,
RAD6
clearly
plays
a
role
in
HRR
in

to
its
central

in

.

Our
present
results
suggest
that
the

.

The
expression
of
E6

was
dramatically
induced
under

was
found
to

An

We
also
show
that
expression
of
MYPT1
enhances
HIF

in
a
manner
consistent
with
competition
for
FIH
and
that
this
property
extends
to
other

.

In

We
previously
demonstrated
that

(
OHPAHs
)
bound
to
a

(

by
a

,
but
polycyclic

did
not
have
a

In
this

,
we
show
that
MAML1
potentiates

Here
the
current

and
how
these
findings
contribute
to
our
broader
understanding
of
recombination
.

This
is
initial
evidence
that
pVHL
,
without
any
genetic

,
can
be
regulated
by

and
explains
the

For
this

,
we
have
generated
a

In

,
our

support
a
model
for
how
the
H3K27me3

could
be
preserved
in
the
interphase
of
the
cell

,
where
other

such
as

could
counteract

.

This

The

p62

protein
shown
to
bind
both
target

)
and
LC3
conjugated
to
the
phagophore

,
thereby
effectively
acting
as
an
autophagic

for

.

NBR1
is
degraded
by
autophagy
depending
on
its
LC3

region
(
LIR
)
but
does
not
strictly
require
p62
for
this
process
.

BubR1
degradation
began
before
the
onset
of
anaphase
.

It
was
noted
that
the
pre

degradation
was
regulated
by
BubR1
acetylation
.

Here
we
present
evidence
that
GCM1
is
a
major
target
of
hypoxia
associated
with

It

,
H

respectively
.

Free
Trp
protected
only
the

by
AAPH
,
the
combination
of
Trp

was
effective
against
all

This
represents
a

Paraptosis

Furthermore
,
the

of
the

was
affected
by
Hg
(

that

We
show
that
the

)
-
E3

complex
,
known
for
its

,
interacts
with
and
ubiquitylates
the
beta

,
thereby
decreasing
receptor

.

Here
we
show
that
DAPK2
is
down

regulated
in
Hodgkin

tumor
cell

and
that
promoter

hypermethylation
is
one
mechanism
for
DAPK2

.

Thus
,
Parkin
is
cytoprotective
,
partially
by
increasing
the

of

through
a

the
only

In

we
characterized
how
the

and
differs
from
TfR1
.

No

was
detected
,
indicating
a
lack
of

In

in
the

The
observation
that

suggests
that

Using
this

,
we
were
able
to
monitor
the
dynamic

of

during

as

as

The

are
governed
largely
by
their

.

During

stress
,
existing
PP2A
complexes
can
become
unstable
.

These
finding
demonstrate
a
previously
unappreciated
level
of
complexity
of
the
ubiquitin
system
in
ERAD
and
have
potentially
important
ramifications
for
processes
where

regulation
of

Studies
on

that
regulate

We
exploited

of

,
an
F

involved
in
entry
into

,
during

.

These

illustrate
a
cellular
response
to
environmental
and
genetic
perturbations
through
remodeling
of
the

Alpha
-
mannosidosis
is
caused
by
the
genetic
defect
of
the
lysosomal
alpha
-
d
-
mannosidase
(
LAMAN
)
,
which
is
involved
in
the
breakdown
of
free
alpha
-
linked
mannose
-
containing
oligosaccharides
originating
from
glycoproteins
with
N
-
linked
glycans
,
and
thus
manifests
itself
in
an
extensive
storage
of
mannose
-
containing
oligosaccharides
.

The
analysis
of
cathepsin
B
-
derived
oligosaccharides
revealed
a
hypermannosylation
of
glycoproteins
in
mice
with
alpha
-
mannosidosis
as
indicated
by
the
predominance
of
extended
Man3GlcNAc2
oligosaccharides
.

Treatment
with
recombinant
human
alpha

mannosidase
partially
corrected
the
hyperglycosylation
of
lysosomal
proteins
in
vivo
and
in

.

Despite
essential
roles
in
development
and
metabolism
,
regulation
of
FoxA
factors
is
not
well
understood
.

Here
,
we
study
one
facet
of
this
CHIP

turnover
by
determining
the
lysine
residues
on
human
Hsp70
and
Hsp90

Usa1p
is
a
recently
discovered
member
of
the
HRD

.

First
,
Hrd1p
self

degradation
,
which
serves
to
limit
the
levels
of
uncomplexed
E3
,
is
absolutely
dependent
on
Usa1p
and
the
ubiquitin
-
like
(
Ubl
)
domain
of
Usa1p
.

The
Ubl
domain
of
Usa1p
was
required
specifically
for
Hrd1p
self
-
ubiquitination
but
not
for
degradation
of
either
ERAD
-
L
or
ERAD
-
M
substrates
.

Thus
,
this
novel
,
conserved
factor
is
broadly
involved
in
the
function
and
regulation
of
the
HRD
pathway
of
ERAD
.

Remarkably
,
acetylation
of
the
amino

terminal
region
abrogates
high

DNA
binding
and
selectively
prevents

of
G

.

In
contrast
,
phosphorylation
does
not
markedly
alter
DNA
interactions
,
but
may
preserve
G

processing
in

by
preventing
CBP

acetylation
.

,
of
which

In

highlighted

On

The
objective
of
these
experiments
was
to
ascertain
whether
the
kinetic
behavior
of
the
MBP
isoforms
reflected
differences
in
the
structures
of
this
molecular
family
.

A
model
system
for
studies
of
mechanisms
governing
the

of

was
developed
.

Maximal

,
occurs
at
about

We
have
taken
advantage

The
results
demonstrate
that
a

deacetylation
continues
within
metaphase

.

Western

immunostaining
with

showed
a

This
difference
was
seen
on
antigens
isolated
from

of
the
parental

as
well
as
from
the
F1

.

These
results
suggest
that
the
dominant
nature
of
the
cheD
mutations
is
manifested
as
a
general
defect
in
the
regulation
of
demethylation
.

In
addition
,

this

The

It
was
established
that
only
the
A

to
the

the

This
suggests
that
dimethylation
takes
place
in
two
successive
stages
.

Types

isolated
from

.
the
distribution
of
the
various
collagen
types
was
normal
in
all

tissues
.

Similar
observations
were
made
with
collagen
from
fetuses
at
various
stages
of

Several

both
the
alpha

beta
domains
become
unmethylated
after
the
switch
from

.

The
magnitude
of
these
methylation
switches
is
small
compared
with
changes
that
occur
in
these
genes
during
normal
avian
erythropoiesis
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
deglycosylation
of
the
SIV

results
in
a

which
binds
neither

the

does

However
,
this

was
not

thereby
suggesting
that

associated

the

:
There

Alteration
of
glycosylation
renders
HIV
sensitive
to
inactivation
by
normal
human
serum
.

In
this
study
,
NHS
sensitivity
of
HIV
was
assessed
following
viral
propagation
in
human
cells
that
were
manipulated
to
express
the
alpha
-
galactosyl
epitope
.

Viral
inactivation
was
abolished
by
the
addition
of
a
synthetic
disaccharide
that
contains
the
alpha
-
galactosyl
epitope
,
indicating
that
virolysis
is
mediated
by
anti
-
alpha
-
galactosyl
natural
Ab
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
,
like
other
retroviruses
bearing
the
alpha

galactosyl
epitope
,
HIV
modified
to
express
this
epitope
is
inactivated
in
NHS
.

In
man
two
genetically
distinct

disorders
are
associated
with
either
a
primary
or
a
secondary

of
lysosomal
neuraminidase
:
sialidosis
and
galactosialidosis
.

In
addition
,
these
mice
have
an
altered
immune
response
that
has
also
been
coupled
to
a
deficiency
of
the
Neu

neuraminidase
.

It
was
synthesized
by
a
baculovirus
vector

insect
cell
system
using
two
cDNAs
encoding
the
glycoprotein
alpha
and
FSH
beta
subunits
.

Rec

pFSH
was
secreted
into
the

medium
at
about
1
mg

,
because
of

Protein
-
disulfide
isomerase
(
PDI
)
has
been
shown
to
be
a
multifunctional
enzyme
catalyzing
the
formation
of
disulfide
bonds
,
as
well
as
being
a
component
of
the
enzymes
prolyl
4
-
hydroxylase
(
P4
-
H
)
and
microsomal
triglyceride
transfer
protein
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
this
multifunctional
protein
within
a
cellular
context
,
we
have
established
a
semi
-
permeabilized
cell
system
that
reconstitutes
the
synthesis
,
folding
,
modification
,
and
assembly
of
procollagen
as
they
would
occur
in
the
cell
.

We
demonstrate
here
that
P4
-
H
associates
transiently
with
the
triple
helical
domain
during
the
assembly
of
procollagen
.

The
gp120
glycoprotein
,
which
can
be
shed
from
the
envelope
complex
,
elicits
both
virus

and
non

neutralizing
antibodies
during
natural

.

The
prolyihydroxylase
subunit
genes
were
cloned
on
either
side
of
a
bidirectional
galactose

inducible
promoter
in
a
low
-
copy
minichromosome
yeast
expression
vector
,
pYEUra3
,
which
is
URA3
selectable
.

The
biological
significance
of
this
observation
is
discussed
as
well
as
the
need
to
carefully
select
CD34
-
specific
monoclonal
antibodies
for
research
and
clinical
purposes
.

Crystal

:
structural
basis
for
the

of

catalyzed
by
diiron

.

In
protein
R2
,
the
likely
reaction
site
for
dioxygen
is
close
to
Phe208
.

In
another
mutant
,
F208Y
,
the
"

Tyr208
is
hydroxylated

Variations
in
N

and
proteolytic

account
for
the
difference
in
molecular
mass
between
mature
recombinant

72
kDa
)
and
human
placental
haSMase
(
75
kDa
)
.

To
do
this
,
we
used
a
novel
UV
laser

induced
protein
-
DNA
cross
-
linking
technique
,
combined
with
immunochemical
and
molecular
biology
approaches
.

Moreover
,
stress
kinase
activation
is
essential
for
CpG

release
of
tumor
necrosis

alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
and
interleukin
-
12
(
IL
-
12
)
,
as
inhibition
of
p38
results
in
severe
impairment
of
this
biological
response
.

We
further
demonstrate
that
cellular
uptake
via
endocytosis
and
subsequent
endosomal
maturation
is
essential
for
signalling
,
since
competition
by
non
-
CpG
-
DNA
or
compounds
blocking
endosomal
maturation
such
as
chloroquine
or
bafilomycin
A
prevent
all
aspects
of
cellular
activation
.

Loss

the
unfolded
protein
response
pathway
,
and
results
in
a
cell
wall
defect
when
combined
with
an
oligosaccharyltransferase
mutation
.

We
propose
that
the
major
role
for
Scj1p
is
to
cooperate
with
Kar2p
to
mediate
maturation
of
proteins
in
the
RER
lumen
.

To
facilitate

gB
,
the
cytoplasmic
tail
of
the
glycoprotein
was
tagged
with
the
influenza

)
epitope
.

HHV

HA
was
sensitive
to

,
and
immunofluorescence
revealed
that
HHV

HA
was
detectable
in
the
perinuclear
region
of
CHO

K1
cells
.

Because
both
HHV

and
EBV
are
gamma
-
herpesviruses
,
the
ability
of
HHV

8
gB
to
interact
with
and
functionally
complement
EBV
gp110
was
examined
.

Mutations
of
appropriate
residues
showed
that
myristoylation
of
the

was
not
necessary
for

.

The

We
investigated
whether
the
increase
in
hydroxylysylpyridinoline
is
due
to
overhydroxylation
of
lysyl
residues
in
the
collagen
molecule
,
which
may
also
be
associated
with
an
increase
of
glycosylated
hydroxylysine
residues
.

Our
results
showed
that
the
overhydroxylation
of
lysyl
residues
,
which
is
required
for
the
generation
of
hydroxylysylpyridinoline
,
is
not
only
restricted
to
the
telopeptides
but
also
affects
the
helical
part
of
the

.

With

Using
radiolabeled

,
we
show
that

of
each

of

is
as
good
or
better
than
with
conventional
approaches
for
isolating
individual
classes
,
and
that
cross

is
minimal
.

Similar

indicate
that
this

is
very
rare
in
ganglioside
glycans
,
even
in

tissues
.

In
this
study
we
fractionated
the
lymphoblastoid
cells
to
locate
the

and
the

in
cells
.

In
the
cell
lines
and
xenografts
with
extensive
methylation
,
no
RASSF1A
gene
expression
was
found
.

These
findings
suggest
that
promoter
hypermethylation
may
participate
in
the
transcriptional
inactivation
of
the
RASSF1A
gene
in
NPC
.

However
,
at
present
,
it
is
not
known
whether
methylation
represses
GSTP1

in
human

In
the

is
composed
of
five
glycoproteins
(
ZPA

.

The
N

glycans
of
the

were
composed
predominantly
of
a
heterogeneous

of
high

(
5

)
and
neutral
,
complex
oligosaccharides
primarily
derived
from
ZPC
(
the
dominant
glycoprotein
)
.

The
consensus
sequence
for
N
-
linked
glycosylation
at
the
evolutionarily
conserved
residue
N113
of
the
ZPC
protein
sequence
was
glycosylated
solely
with
high

oligosaccharides
.

Further
,
peptide

,
which
are
specific
for
the

of
N

linkages
,
respectively
,
in
glycoproteins
were
used
.

Pretreatment
with
either
of
them
also
reduced
both
PGD2

activities
.

The
reduction
was
dependent
on
the

.

Moreover
,

,
we
found
that

The
second
pattern
(

)
refers
to
sites
embedded
in

variation
and
is
characterized
by
shifts
in
terms
of
the
relative
position
and
local
density
of
sequons
;
these
sites
tend
to
be

We
demonstrate
that

In
this
work
,
basidiomycetous
yeasts
belonging
to
Pseudozyma
spp
.
were
studied
with
respect
to
their
amenability
to
heterologous
protein
production
.

Single

or
cotransformation
experiments
routinely
afforded
100

for
the
two

species
of

of

were
comprised
of
one

a
few
short

that
possess
a
classic
eukaryotic

typical
of
higher
fungi

.

These
results
suggest
that
the
binding
of
hydroxylated
lecithin
to
unfolded
monomers
or
intermediate
products
of
beta

lg
reduces
the
extent
of
heat

of

and
consequently
decreases
the
interactions
between
unadsorbed
beta

and

.

In
the
presence
of

,
HIFalpha

are
hydroxylated
on
one
of
two
conserved

by
members
of
the
egg

.

Together
,
these
findings
demonstrate
that
each
hydroxylated
proline
of
HIF

1alpha
has
a
distinct
activity
in
controlling
HIF
-
1alpha
stability
in
response
to
different
levels
of
oxygenation
.

Is
this
position
equally
important
for
enhancement
of
both
enzyme
activities
?

This
provides
evidence
that
H3K36me2
is
established
during
the
initial
instances
of
gene
transcription
,
with
subsequent
transcription
having
at
most
a
maintenance
role
.

However
,

not
consider
it
at

Epigenetic

Additionally
,
we
mapped
the

,
showed
that
this
region
capable
of

,
and
demonstrated
that

These

suggested
that
the

To

was
to

and
to
demonstrate
the

STAT1

which
catalyzes

We
also
highlight
unresolved

in
this
area
,
including
the
question
of
how
a

Taken
together
,
we
propose
that

,
at

in

proteins
with
various
N

revealed
that

required
at

.

This
process
is
initiated
by
a
family
of
mechanistically

.

A
broad
understanding
of
how
E1

activate
UBLs
and
how
they
selectively
coordinate
UBLs
with
downstream
function
has
come
from
enzymatic

structural
and
genetic
studies
.

We
found
that
AA

results
in
a

,
which
is

It
was

RESULTS
:
In

were
devoid
of
a

Acetylation

METHODS
:
The

were
determined
in
human

microsomes
from
six
genotyped
CYP2C19

.

Selective
inhibitors
of

specific
monoclonal

to
various
cytochrome

were
also
employed
.

These
results
demonstrated
that

ordinated
with
an

can
occur
without

We

a
central

in
the

that
constitutes
the

.

It
also
develops
hyperleptinemia

Recent

have
defined
an

with

is
regulated
by
prolyl

.

A

Whereas
H3

has
been
correlated
with

,
H3

Lys9

has
been
linked
to
gene

and
assembly
of
heterochromatin
in
mouse

.

In

,
H3
methylated
at

is
depleted
in
the
inactive
X

,
except
in
three
'
hot

'
of

Chromosomal

As
widely
believed
treating

,
an

results
in

However
,
the

to
the
repression
of

was
determined
in

A

,
presumably
the

was
also
strongly
expressed
.

By
the
two

cell
stage
,
expression
of
the

was
minimal
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
the
subcellular

and
posttranslational
modification
of
PKC

is
cell

,
suggesting
that
its

DNA

is
a

The
addition
of
a

at
the

of

bases
occurs
exclusively
at

These

in
the

Deregulated

,
a
secreted

with
multiple
biological

,
has
been
associated
with
the

of
various

.

We
therefore
analysed
the
expression
pattern
and
methylation
status
of
the
SPARC
gene
in
pancreatic

.

These
findings
suggest
that
SPARC
is
a
frequent
target
for
aberrant
methylation
in
pancreatic
cancer
and
that
SPARC
expression
in
fibroblasts
adjacent
to
pancreatic

cells
is
regulated
through
tumor

Although

region
associated
with
oncogenesis
and

of
gastric
carcinoma
.

The
relation
between
silencing
of
the
Syk
gene
and
methylation
of
Syk
promoter
region
was
also
studied
.

CONCLUSION
:
Hypermethylation
leads
to
silencing
of
the
Syk
gene
in
human
gastric
carcinoma
.

Besides
the
hormonal
pathway
involved
in
the
progression
of
preneoplastic
and
neoplastic
lesions
,
alterations
of
the
DNA
methylation
status
have
been
shown
to
be
an
early
signal
of
tumorigenesis
.

Human
PAD4
regulates
histone
arginine
methylation
levels
via
demethylimination
.

Methylation
of
arginine
(
Arg
)
and
lysine
residues
in
histones
has
been
correlated
with
epigenetic
forms
of
gene
regulation
.

Increased
methylation
of
p16
or
O6
methylguanine
methyltranferase
(
MGMT
)
was
detected
in
4
/

(
50
%
)
of
the
tumor
samples
from
mice
promoted
with
27
mg
CSC
.

We
also
analyzed
histone
acetylation
and
methylation
by
immunocytochemistry
with
antibodies
to
H4
acetylated
at
lysine
8
,
H3
trimethylated
at
lysine
9
,
and
H3
methylated
at
lysine
4
.

To
explore
the
origins
of
other
acetylated
taxoids
,
the
group
of
recombinant
Taxus
acyltransferases
was
investigated
with
a
range
of
polyhydroxylated
taxoids
as
substrates
.

These
results
suggest
that
both
TAX1
and
TAX19
acyltransferases
may
function
at
the
early
C5
acetylation
step
of
taxoid
metabolism
,
and
that
the
TAX19
acyltransferase
,
because
of
its
broader
specificity
for
polyhydroxylated
taxoids
,
may
also
function
later
in
metabolism
and
be
responsible
for
the
production
of
many
other
acetylated
taxoids
.

During
embryogenesis
,
the
murine
Pomt1
gene
is
prominently
expressed
in
the
neural
tube
,
the
developing
eye
,
and
the
mesenchyme
.

The
product
of
the
YDR140w
gene
is
required
for
the
methylation
of
eRF1
in

and
for
optimal
yeast
cell
growth
.

Hepatitis

virus
(
HDV
)
contains
a
circular

.

NS1
produced
in

.

Temperature

studies
comparing
the
growth
of
the
viruses
at
37
degrees
C
and
39

showed
no
significant
differences
compared
to
the
WT

.

Surprisingly
,
all
of
these
changes
are
well
accommodated
within
an
insulin

.

Ovarian

were
extracted
,
purified
,
and

In

we
examined
the

,
as
a
first
step
towards
gaining

We
provide
quick

for
the
isolation
of

and
give
basic

for
the

This

was
reduced
when
the

with
the

Also

Although
the
molecular

underlying
these

are
presently
unknown
,
the
possibility
that
they
may
be
related
to
aberrations
in
glucose
or

are
considered
.

Also

Several

We

the

aspect
of
the
influence
of
the

Kinetic

by
turbidimetry
showed
a
sizeable
increase
of
absorbance
only
for
the
two
N
-
methylated
samples
forming
specific
supramolecular

;
however
,
the
derivatization
affects
aggregation
kinetics
by
increasing
lag

and
decreasing
maximum

of

,
and
lowers

.

The

in
Chlamydomonas

confer

.

This
pattern
of
altered

to
different
microtubule
inhibitors
was
found
to
cosegregate
and
corevert
with
the
beta

providing
the

that
the
in

Recently
,

found
to
attenuate
accumulation
of
hypoxia
inducible

-
1alpha
(
HIF

)
under
hypoxic
conditions
because
of
several
mechanisms
:
redistribution
of
oxygen
toward
non

respiratory
oxygen
-
dependent
targets
(
like
HIF
-
1alpha
proline
hydroxylases
-
-
PHDs
,
which
perform
hydroxylation
of
Pro402
/
564
of
HIF
-
1alpha
leading
to
its
proteasomal
degradation
)
;
in
addition
,
peroxynitrite
formed
during
interactions
between
NO

derived
superoxide
leads
to
an
increase
in
cytosolic
iron
/

(

)
,
which
required
for

This

is
crucial
for
several
aspects
of
LPL

,
such
as
intracellular

and
high

attachment
to

.

Since

These

support
the
notion
that
glycosylated
surface

hinder
CD8
T

and
function
in
both
young

,
and
raise
the
possibility
of
significantly
improving

through

In
this

,
we
demonstrate
that
pre

enhances

in

In

,
we
demonstrate
that

However
,
at
the

possessed
an

METHODS
:
The

of
DNMT1
and
DNMT3b
were
examined
by
immunohistochemistry
in

from

.

It
was
much
more
expressed
in
the
lower
grade
or
more

.

Using
in

assays
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
levels
of
iron
(
Fe
)
,
ascorbate
,
and
various
tricarboxylic

(
TCA

cycle
intermediates
affect

During

become
exposed
.

We
also
discuss
how
gene

may
affect
the
mechanism
of
pathogenesis
and
immune

.

This
methodology
is
applicable
to
other

and
will
likely
be
a
valuable
tool
in
understanding
the
roles
of

The

As
angiogenesis
is
fundamental
to

,
we
examined
the
effect
of
TAPS
on

using
human

cultured
in

.

Recognizing
its
inhibitory
potential
on

,
we
further
investigated
the

of
TAPS

NC
possesses
arginine
dimethylation
sites
in
each
of
its
two
basic

at
positions
R10

,
and
methylated
NC
was
less
able
than
wild
-
type
to
promote
RNA
annealing
and
participate
in
the
initiation
of
reverse
transcription
.

CONCLUSION
:
NC
is
an
in
-
vivo
target
of
PRMT6
,
and
arginine
methylation
of
NC
reduces
RNA
annealing
and
the
initiation
of
reverse

.

These

suggested
that
EGFR
-
PTK
signaling
also
affects

of

other
than

.

Thus
,
EGFR

modulates

as
well
as

"
occurring
in
all

transferrins
was
not
found
,
which
indicates
a
different
mechanism
of
iron

.

While
we
did
not
find
any
evidence
that
N
-
linked
glycans
of
E1
contribute
to
the
masking
of

,
our
data
demonstrate
that
at
least
three
glycans
on
E2
(
denoted
E2N1
,
E2N6
,
and
E2N11
)
reduce
the
sensitivity
of
HCVpp
to
antibody
neutralization
.

Importantly
,
these
three
glycans
also
reduced
the
access
of
CD81
to
its
E2
binding
site
,
as
shown
by
using
a
soluble
form
of
the
extracellular

To
investigate
the
clinical

,
we
evaluated
the
relationship
between
clinicopathologic

and
the
pattern

decreases
the
extent
of

Crystallographic
analyses
of

35A
)
and
of
Notch
peptides
bound
to
FIH
(

.
4

6A
)
reveal
the
stereochemistry
of
hydroxylation
on
the
AR
and
imply
that
significant
conformational
changes
are
required
in
the
ARD
fold
in
order
to
enable
hydroxylation
at
the
FIH
active
site
.

We
presently
investigated
whether
sensitivity
could
be
increased
by
consideration
of
a
third
gene
,
which
encodes
retinoic

(

.

No

CONCLUSIONS
:
Including
the

Given
that
mutations
in
genes
of
the
RAS
pathway
are
rarely
observed
in
uveal

,
epigenetic
inactivation
of

may
be
an
alternative
mechanism
of

.

We
analyze
the
protein
arginine

that
catalyze
the

The
human

,
located
5

and
an

region
that
recruits
the
transcription
factors
Oct

)
.

We
show
that
Staf
activates
U6
transcription
from
a
preassembled

template
in

and
associates
with
several
proteins
linked
to

define

Previous

Our

suggest
that
the

binds
to

that

Based

we

BACKGROUND

RESULTS
:
Four
novel

were
identified
in

Our
observation
that
a

R
CXCR4
,
which
cannot
be
ubiquitinated
and
does
not
mediate
a

response
to

,
indicates
the
importance
of
this
covalent

not
only
in
marking
receptors
for
degradation
but
also
for
permitting
CXCR4

Further
,
these

suggest
that

indirectly
influences
the

The
aim

was
to
determine
whether

Here

and
enhances

,
ultimately
resulting

.

The
expression
of

markedly
enhanced
cellular

to

but
,
surprisingly
,
did
not
induce

in

.

In

Conversely

the

(
G37A
and

)
,
in
which
two
highly
conserved
residues
were
mutated
.

In

experiments
demonstrated
that
dissociation
of
mutant
Sus1
from
its
partners
is
caused
by
a
reduced

toward
the

It
challenges
the
notion
that

is
solely
associated
with
an
increase
in
polycomb
function
and
suggests
that
any
imbalance
in
polycomb
activity
could
drive
the
cell
toward
oncogenesis
.

Collectively
,
these
data
provide
evidence
that
cigarette

directly
engages
polycomb
machinery
to
activate
a

implicated
in

of

Thus
,
decreased

may
lead
to

ERK
activation
by
failing
to
regulate
a

downstream
of

.

We
further
demonstrate
that
Drosophila
Ras
is
ubiquitylated
.

Additionally

the

previously
to
catalyze

We
show
that
loss
of
the

results
in
increased
levels
of
aPKC
and
leads
to
defects
in

.

We
further
demonstrate
that
,
despite
its
somewhat
relaxed
substrate
specificity
for
N

acetylation
,
Cj1123c
cannot
acetylate
aminoglycosides
,
indicating
a

Removal
of
harmful
protein
aggregates
is
mediated
by
autophagy
,
a
mechanism
by
which
the
cell
sequesters
cytosolic
cargo
and
delivers
it
for
degradation
by
the
lysosome
.

It
is
concluded
that
the
lowering
of
the
binding
activity
of
MDBP

2
may
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
derepression
of
the
gene
than
the
slow
demethylation
of

site
.

To
address
the
mechanism
underlying
this
phenomenon
,
we
characterized
the
MoAbs
,
and
found
that
one
of
the
clones
recognized
a
molecule
that
was
down

regulated
in
the
RzM6

.

This

was
purified
and
identified
as

The

To
gain
insight
into
the
differential
mechanism
of
gene

hypermethylation
in
acute

,
we
identified
the

status
on
one
part
of

of

.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that

is
mediated
by
STAT6
,
a

The

was
similar
to
that
of
an

METHODS
:
Forty
-
four
patients
with

)
who
participated
in
a

,
were
tested
by
capture
ELISA
for
ANCA
against
PR3
and
deglycosylated
recombinant

of

.

Research
in
yeast
further
indicates
that
the

SKP2
and
CKS1
promote
degradation
of
cell

and
are
associated

.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:
The
cell
cycle
regulators
P21
(
WAF1
)
,
P27
(
KIP1
)
,
P57
(
KIP2
)
,
P130
,
RASSF1A
,
and
FOXO1
are
down
-
regulated
during
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
pathogenesis
.

Messenger
RNA
levels
of
these
genes
were
up
-
regulated
in
samples
in
which
these
genes
were
not
methylated
;
protein
levels
increased
only
in
HCCB
because
of
CKS1
-
and
SKP2
-
dependent
ubiquitination
of
these
proteins
in
HCCP
.

In
HCC
cells
,
small
interfering
RNA
knockdown
of
SKP2
reduced
proliferation
and
ubiquitination
of
the
cell
cycle
regulators
,
whereas
SKP2
increased
proliferation
and
reduced
expression
of
cell
cycle
regulators
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Ubiquitination
and
proteasome
degradation
of
P21WAF1
,
P27KIP1
,
P57KIP2
,
P130
,
RASSF1A
,
and
FOXO1
and
mechanisms
that
prevent
degradation
of
SKP2
by
APC
/

CDH1
contribute
to
HCC
progression
.

A
stronger
expression
was
present
in
nerve
fibers
,
particularly
in
PCa
,
in
immune
cells
and
in
smooth
muscle
and
endothelial
cells
of
vessels
of
BPH
and
PCa
.

There
are
approximately
79
active
deubiquitinating
enzymes
(
DUBs
)
predicted
in
the
human
genome
.

Whereas
many
cytosolic
and
membrane
components
of
this
system
are
known
,
only
few
luminal
players
have
been
identified
.

Matriptase
is
a
type
II
transmembrane
serine
protease
containing
one
potential
site
for
asparagine
-
linked
glycosylation
(
N
-
glycosylation
)
on
the
catalytic
domain
(
Asn772
)
.

Excess
unlabeled
LPL
prevented
the
immunoadsorption
of
this
labeled
species
,
hence
the
labeled
species
was
determined
to
be
LPL
.

A
single
35SO4
-
labeled
tryptic
peptide
was
isolated
by
reverse
phase
chromatography
.

The
amino
acid
sequence
of
the
peptide
established
that
the
35SO4
oligosaccharide
is
conjugated
at
Asn
-
45
.

Sequential
exoglycosidase
digestion
,
thin
layer
chromatography
of
the
released
monosaccharides
,
and
the
use
of
glycosylation
inhibitors
established
that
the
sulfated
sugar
is
a
core
N
-
acetylglucosamine
(
GlcNAc
)
.

However
the
7
-
and
6
-
hydroxy
substitution
were
observed
to
be
more
favourable
for
SOR
scavenging
activities
as
compared
to
other
hydroxyl
substitutions
.

In
primary
dendritic
cell
and
APC
cell
lines
of
murine
origin
,
MARCH1
had
a
half

life
of
<
30
min
.

Thrombopoietin
(
Tpo
)
,
acting
through
its
receptor
c
-
Mpl
,
is
required
for
hematopoietic
stem
cell
maintenance
and
megakaryopoiesis
.

Jmjd1a
is
a
key
epigenetic
regulator
expressed
in
the
testis
.

Interestingly
,
the
altered
histone
modifications
in
Jmjd1a
-
deficient
germ
cells
caused
diminished
cAMP
-
response
element
modulator
(
Crem
)
recruitment
to
chromatin
and
decreased
expression
of
the
Crem
coactivator
Act
and
their
target
genes
Tnp1
(
transition
protein
1
)
,
Tnp2
,
Prm1
(
protamine
1
)
,
and
Prm2
,
all
of
which
are
essential
for
chromatin
condensation
in
spermatids
.

In
agreement
with
these
findings
,
Jmjd1a
deficiency
caused
extensive
germ
cell
apoptosis
and
blocked
spermatid
elongation
,
resulting
in
severe
oligozoospermia
,
small
testes
,
and
infertility
in
male
mice
.

Further
studies
revealed
two
potential
pathways
mediated
nickel
and
hypoxia
induced
c
-
myc
degradation
.

Among
the
targets
we
screened
,
we
identified
Fgfr3
as
a
direct
transcriptional
target
of
the
Ap2delta
-
Ash2l
complex
.

Thus
,
we
have
identified
several
candidate
targets
of
complexes
containing
Ap2delta
and
Ash2l
that
can
be
used
to
further
elucidate
their
roles
during
development
and
showed
that
Fgfr3
is
a
novel
direct
target
of
these
complexes
.

Here
we
report
on
the
characterization
of
TGIF
as
an
essential
component
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF
-
alpha
)
cytotoxic
program
.

Notably
,
we
found
that
activation
of
TNF
-
alpha
signaling
induced
the
association
of
TGIF
with
Itch
/
AIP4
,
resulting
in
increased
accessibility
of
cFlip
(
L
)
for
association
and
ubiquitination
by
Itch
/
AIP4
.

TRC8
knockdown
had
opposite
effects
in
sterol
-
deprived
cells
.

In
Drosophila
,
growth
inhibition
by
DTrc8
was
genetically
suppressed
by
loss
of
specific
Mprlp
,
Padlp
N
-
terminal
domain
-
containing
proteins
found
in
the
COP9
signalosome
and
eIF3
.

Furthermore
,
loss
of
phosphorylated
H3
-
T45
causes
phenotypes
consistent
with
replicative
defects
,
and
prolonged
replication
stress
results
in
H3
-
T45
phosphorylation
accumulation
over
time
.

N4BP1
is
a
newly
identified
nucleolar
protein
that
undergoes
SUMO
-
regulated
polyubiquitylation
and
proteasomal
turnover
at
promyelocytic
leukemia
nuclear

.

However
,
a
small
fraction
is
found
at
promyelocytic
leukemia
(

)
nuclear
bodies
(
NBs
)
.

An
intronic
expansion
of
GAA
triplets
in
the
FXN
-
encoding
gene
,
FXN
,
causes
gene
silencing
and
thus
reduced
FXN
protein
levels
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
finding
novel
strategies
to
overcome
the
transcription
elongation
problem
may
develop
into
promising
new
treatments
for
FRDA
.

SAGA
is
a
transcriptional
coactivator
complex
that
is
conserved
across
eukaryotes
and
performs
multiple
functions
during
transcriptional
activation
and
elongation
.

The
deubiquitinating
activity
depends
on
the
presence
of
all
four
DUBm
proteins
.

In
the
presence
of
endotoxin
,
an
increase
in
caveolin
-
1
(
Cav
-
1
)
expression
impairs
ET
-
1
/
eNOS
signaling
;
however
,
the
molecular
mechanism
is
unknown
.

Following
LPS
pretreatment
,
CD
+
ET
-
1
failed
to
stimulate
eNOS
activity
(
+
51
%
,
P
>
0
.
05
)
,
which
contributed
to
the
reduced
levels
of
eNOS
-
Ser1177
phosphorylation
and
eNOS
-
Thr495
dephosphorylation
,
the
LPS
/
CD
-
induced
overexpression
and
translocation
of
Cav
-
1
in
the
perinuclear
region
,
and
the
increased
perinuclear
colocalization
of
eNOS
with
Cav
-
1
.

Furthermore
,
we
present
that
EL4
treated
with
Dox
-
HPMA
(
AM
)
possesses
increased
sensitivity
to
galectin
-

.

We
conclude
that
SIRT1
orthologs
play
a
critical
role
in
controlling
SREBP
-
dependent
gene
regulation
governing
lipid
/
cholesterol
homeostasis
in
metazoans
in
response
to
fasting
cues
.

Control
experiments
indicated
that
the
oocyte
protein
carboxyl
methyltransferase
was
not
saturated
with
endogenous
substrates
,
since
protein
carboxyl
methylation
rates
could
be
stimulated
up
to
8
-
fold
by
increasing
concentrations
of
injected
calmodulin
.

At
steady
state
,
oocyte
calmodulin
contains
approximately
0
.
0002
esters
/
mol
of
protein
,
which
turn
over
rapidly
.

The
recently
isolated
,
naturally
occurring
peptide
hormones
[
Hyp3
]
-
bradykinin
and
[
Hyp3

-
Lys

bradykinin
were
investigated
for
their
agonist
activity
on
solubilized
binding
sites
from
human
fibroblasts
.

In
contrast
,
no
LAMP
-
2
could
be
detected
on
the
cell
surface
either
before
or
after
differentiation
of
F
-
9
cells
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
differentiation
of
EC
cells
is
accompanied
by
changes
in
the
synthesis
and
glycosylation
of
LAMP
glycoproteins
and
that
these
changes
are
specific
for
the
cell
type
that
results
after
differentiation
.

A

was
produced
by

.

In
order
to
investigate
the
possible
role
of
the
Trp
residue
in
ACTH
as
a
change
-
transfer
donor
in
the
activation
of
ACTH
receptors
,
two
ACTH
analogues
(
beta

corticotrophins
(
I
-

)
with
L
-
Ser1
and
D
-
Ser1
,
respectively
)
containing
pentamethylphenylalanine
instead
of
Trp
have
been
synthesized
.

The
association
constants
of
ACTH
(
I
-

)
and
(
Pmp9
)
-
ACTH
(
I
-
24
)
with
the
water

soluble
acceptor
paraquat
,
were
nearly
equal
.

An
extensive
immunohistochemical
study
of
other
normal
tissues
reveals
that
the
majority
show
only
weak
focal
staining
with
SM
-
3
or
none
at
all
,
the
distal
tubules
and
collecting
ducts
of
the
kidney
,
and
sebaceous
glands
being
the
only
normal
tissues
studied
to
show
homogeneously
positive
staining
.

Because
cytosine
phosphoguanine
(
CpG
)
methylation
has
been
reported
to
correlate
inversely
with
gene
activity
,
the
demethylation
of
cytosine
residues
in
the
quail
vitellogenin
2
(
Vg2
)
gene
was
assessed
as
a
possible
contributing
factor
.

Changes
in
the
methylation
pattern
of
CCGG
sites
of
the
quail
Vg2
gene
were
studied
using
the
methyl
-
sensitive
restriction
endonucleases
Msp
I
and
Hpa
II
.

Another
site
,
within
the
3
'
flanking
sequences
or
the
3
'
structural
gene
region
,
underwent
estradiol
-
dependent
demethylation
in
the
liver
and
the
oviduct
.

The
expression
-
linked
demethylation
of
the
CCGG
sites
in
the
Vg2
gene
of
quail
appears
to
be
similar
to
that
reported
for
the
chicken
VTGII

.

The

of

in

The

reaction
proceeds
with
the
same
stereospecificity
and
occurs
only
at
the
aspartate
corresponding
to
the
position
seen
in

.

However
,
neither
the
variation
in
amino
acid
sequence
nor
the
variation
in
degree
or

of

measurably
affected
the
non

However
,
it
was
evident
that

At

,
both

The

that
the
presence
of
N
-
linked
sugars
is
not
necessary
for
Fc
epsilon
RI
alpha
binding
.

The
availability
of
these
recombinant
IgE

proteins
will
be
helpful
in
elucidating
the
key
epitopes
essential
for
the
binding
of
IgE
to
its

.

The
precursor
of
the
acid

hormone
gastrin
gives
rise
to
multiple
peptides
differing
markedly
in
biological
activity
,
but
the
relevant
biosynthetic
pathways
are
poorly
understood
.

The
translational
activity
and
level
of
elastin
mRNA
were
essentially
unchanged
throughout

The

Extensive
mutagenesis
studies
of
the

)
revealed
important
residues
(
Cys

,
Tyr
-
385
and
Cys

390
)
for
binding
of
TSH
in
its
C

terminal
region
.

The
long
extracellular

of
the
TSHR
has
5

sites
.

We
have
isolated

encoding
two
distinct
types
of
CuZn
superoxide
dismutases
(
SODs
)
from
the
filarial
nematode
parasite
Brugia
pahangi
.

Digestion
with
N
-
glycanase
indicated
that
the
latter
protein
corresponded
to
the
EC
form
,
as
it
possessed
N
-
linked
oligosaccharide
chains
at
three
sites
,
leaving
a
peptide
backbone
with
an
estimated
molecular
mass
of
22
kDa
,
which
was
consistent
with
the
additional
27
amino
acids
predicted
from
the
cDNA
sequence
.

When
this
enhancer
is
placed
in
an
upstream
position
,
however
,
the
kappa
gene
remains
modified
and
transcriptionally
inactive
,
demonstrating
that
demethylation
is
required
for
kappa
chain
activation
.

Deletions
of
5
to
8
residues
within
predicted
alpha

helices
resulted
in
the
failure
of
export
of
the
mutant
protein
from
the
cell
.

Replacement
of
Cys29
and
Cys33
by
tyrosine
residues
also
resulted
in
the
export
of
fully
active
Epo
.

Therefore
,
this
small
disulfide
loop
is
not
critical
to
Epo
'
s
stability
or
function
.

Production

suggesting
that

is
a
glycoprotein
involved

.

To
study
the
roles
of
N
-
glycosylation
in
the
GnT
-
III
function
,
rat
GnT
-
III
was
expressed
in
COS
-

cells
under
tunicamycin
or
castanospermine
treatment
.

The
castanospermine
-
treated
GnT
-
III
was
not
localized
in
the
Golgi
,
but
glucosylation
did
not
affect
its
activity
.

All
the
mutants
exhibited
lower
enzyme
activity
than
the
wild
-
type
,
but
deglycosylation
at
individual
sites
had
different
effects
on
the
enzyme
activity
.

Kinetic
analysis
revealed
that
the
deglycosylation
at
Asn243
or
Asn261
resulted
in
slightly
lower
affinity
for
the
donor
substrate
,
but
the
other
mutation
did
not
significantly
change
the
K
(
m
)
value
for
either
the
donor
or
acceptor
.

This
is
the
first
demonstration
that
the
glycosyltransferase
localized
in
the
Golgi
apparatus
requires
N
-
glycosylation
for
its
activity
and
retention
.

Recent
studies
of
osteoporotic
bone
,
for
example
,
have
demonstrated
that
subtle
perturbations
in
the
pattern
of
lysine
hydroxylation
result
in
changes
in
the
cross
-
link
profile
.

In
Xenopus
BMP4
appears
to
play
an
essential
role
in
dorsoventral
patterning
,
promoting
the
development
of
ventral
fates
during
gastrula
stages
.

Overexpression
of
either
gene
inhibits
the
development
of
dorsoanterior
structures
in
whole
embryos
and
ventralizes
activin
-
induced
dorsal
mesoderm
in
animal
caps
.

Maturation
of
clusterin
is
governed
by
the
relative
actions
of
sialyltransferases
and
sialidases
that
are
present
in
brain
microsomes
,
golgi
bodies
,
cytosol
and
plasma
membranes
.

Therefore
,
in
this
investigation
,
we
have
studied
the
specific
effects
of
chronic
ethanol
treatment
on
the
glycosylation
of
rat
brain
clusterin
and
the
causes
that
may
lead
to
any
possible
defects
in
the
glycosylation
process
.

Unspliced

Treatment
of
infected
cells
with
tunicamycin
and
digestion
of
immunoprecipitated
proteins
with
various
endoglycosidases
revealed
that
P42
is
modified
by
the
addition
of
a
high

mannose
oligosaccharide
chain
to
generate
P44
.

A
monoclonal

against

like

,
was
able
to
immunoprecipitate
both
the
P42
and

HpaII

Bsh1236I
and

.

We
then
investigated
whether
the
previously
described
down
-
regulation
of
IRF
-
4
expression
in
human
myeloid
leukemias
was
due
to
a
differential
hypermethylation
of
the
promoter
,
since
the
presented
re
-
expression
due
to
AzadC
-
treatment
might
also
be
a
result
of
activation
of
positive
transcriptional
regulators
of

.

In
colon
,
lung
and
hematologic
malignancies
,
overexpression
of
DNMT1
,
a
maintenance
DNMT
,
has
been
detected
(
39
-
41
)
.

In
this
work
,
we
did
not
detect
significant
mRNA
expression
differences
of
selected
DNMT
or
MBP
,
making
it
an
unlikely
cause
for
the
observed
methylation
and
thus
IRF
-
4
expression
differences
in
leukemia
cells
.

Indeed
,
several
clinical
trials
with
leukemia
patients
and
patients
with
myelodysplastic
syndromes
demonstrated
the
potential
clinical
benefit
of
a
treatment
with
demethylating
agents
(
42
-
45
)
.

In
addition
,
recent
studies
have
provided
strong
evidence
that
dysregulation
of
Treg
development
and
/
or
function
may
be
a
significant
factor
in
the
pathogenesis
of
several
autoimmune
disorders
(
e
.
g
.
,
multiple
sclerosis
[
5
]
,
myasthenia
gravis
[

]
,
and

[

)
and

(

[
HAM

,
and
HIV

induced
AIDS
[

-

]
)
.

Unlike
full
-
length
Foxp3
,
which
localizes
almost
exclusively
to
the
nucleus
and
can
bind
in
a
sequence
-
specific
manner
to
forkhead
binding
sites
,
the
deltaFKH
mutant
fails
to
localize
to
the
nucleus
and
thus
cannot
interact
with
promoter
elements
or
nuclear
proteins
[
16
]
.

Overexpression
of
full
-
length
Foxp3
,
but
not
of
deltaFKH
,
was
able
to
suppress
activation
of
a
cotransfected
NF
-
kappaB
reporter
vector
in
HEK
293T
cells
(
Figure
2B
)
.

However
,
directly
comparing
the
effect
of
Foxp3
overexpression
on
the
activation
of
these
two
viral
promoters
demonstrated
that
Foxp3
was
more
capable
of
suppressing
transcriptional
activation
of
the
HIV
-
1
LTR
(
Figure
3D
)
compared
to
the
mutated
HIV
-
1
LTR
(
Figure
3E
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
Foxp3
down
-
regulation
of
HIV
-
1
LTR
activation
was
mediated
at
least
in
part
by
cis
-
acting
NF
-
kappaB
binding
sites
.

HTLV
-
I
encodes
a
multifunctional
transactivator
protein
,
Tax
,
capable
of
activating
both
the
NF
-
kappaB
and
CREB
pathways
[
24
-
29
]
.

To
test
these
hypotheses
,
we
overexpressed
HTLV
-
I
Tax
,
full
-
length
Foxp3
,
and
/
or
deltaFKH
in
HEK
293T
cells
cotransfected
with
an
HTLV
-
I
LTR
or
NF
-
kappaB
reporter
vector
.

We
therefore
quantitated
the
Foxp3
protein
expression
in
CD4
+
CD25
+
T
cells
by
flow
cytometry
and
the
HTLV

(
a
surrogate
marker
of
viral

)
by
real
-
time
PCR
from
eight
patients
with
HAM
/
TSP
and
eight
asymptomatic
carriers
(
ACs
)
.

As
expected
,
patients
with
HAM
/
TSP
exhibited
significantly
higher
proviral
loads
(
indicated
as
HTLV

)
(

)
compared
to

)
(
p
=

)
.

Deletion
of
the
FKH
domain
of
Foxp3
dampened
the
suppressive
effect
of
Foxp3
,
but
did
not
completely
abrogate
suppression
,
as
is
seen
with
NF
-
kappaB
-
responsive
promoters
in
HEK
293T
cells
.

Overexpression
of
Foxp3
was
capable
of
down
-
regulating
forskolin
-
induced
CREB
transcriptional
activation
.

However
,
when
we
attempted
to
determine
whether
Foxp3
could
physically
interact
with
the
coactivator
protein
p300
,
we
found
that
p300
immunoprecipitated
Foxp3
when
both
proteins
were
overexpressed
in
HEK
293T
cells
(
Figure
7D
)
.

It
is
possible
that
the
FKH

Latent

(

)
is
considered
the
major
oncoprotein
of
EBV
,
as
it
transforms
rodent
fibroblasts
to
tumorigenicity
in
nude
mice
and
is
expressed
in
HD
,
NPC
,
and
immunosuppression
-
associated
tumors
[

-

]
.

Activation
of
NFkappaB
is
required
for
EBV
-
induced
B
cell
transformation
and
its
inhibition
rapidly
results
in
cell
death
[

.

,
respectively
,
are
necessary
for
GC
formation
,
but
either
region
is
sufficient
to
induce
extrafollicular
B
cell
differentiation
and
restore
low

LMP1
expression
was

.

Interestingly
,
very
low
levels
of
expression
of
both

chains
were
detected
by

.

These
findings
indicate
that
expression
of
LMP1
in
B

1a
cells
promotes
the
development
of
malignancy
and
can
result
in
the
aberrant
escape
from

that
were

Although
LMP1
has
been
shown
to
deregulate
the
Rb
pathway
in
epithelial
cells
[
69
]
,
to
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
demonstration
of
this
property
in
B
lymphocytes
.

The
requirement
for
Akt
activation
was
confirmed
by
the
striking
inhibition
of
lymphoma
viability
by
triciribine
,
an
Akt
inhibitor
.

This
effect
has
also
been
described
in
EBV

positive
HD

[

]
.

It
has
been
shown
that
overstimulation
of
CD40

with

antibodies
inhibits
GC
formation
[

.

We

regulate
the

,
respectively
.

In
this

,
we
have
used
in

such
as
those
developed
to
study
CD4

T
cell
differentiation
to
define
the
molecular

The

and
T

are
needed
for
important
aspects
of

(

.

Although
Runx3
is
not
expressed
in
naive
CD4

cells
,
its
expression
is
up

regulated
during

influences

Distinct

B
during

in

Perforin
and
granzyme
B
expression
are
not
appreciably
regulated
by
T
-
bet

To
test
the
model
outlined
in
the
previous
paragraph
directly
,
we
compared
the
expression
of
IFN
-
gamma
,
perforin
,
and
granzyme
B
in
CD8
+
T
cells
from
WT
and
Tbx21
(
T
-
bet
)
-
deficient
mice
.

Notably
,
this
deleterious
effect
of
T
-
bet
deficiency
was
only
observed
in
differentiating
CD8
+
T
cells
until
day
4
of
culture
but
was
almost
completely
mitigated
by
day
6
(
Fig
.

)
.

We
consistently
observed
a
modest
reduction
in
GzmB
mRNA
in
T
-
bet
-
deficient
T
cells
(
Fig
.
2
B
,
compare
lanes
1
and
4
)
,
which
did
not
translate
into
a
decrease
in
expression
of
granzyme
B
protein
(
Fig
.
2
C
)
.

We
previously
reported
that
Th1
cell
differentiation
was
regulated
through
a
feed
-
forward
loop
in
which
T
-
bet
is
up
-
regulated
early
and
induces
Runx3
,
after
which
T
-
bet
and
Runx3
cooperate
to
induce
IFN
-
gamma
and
silence
IL
-
4
,
thus
promoting
stable
differentiation
toward
the
Th1
lineage
(
15
,
22
)
.

Because
of
the
limited
number
of
CD8
+
T
cells
in
these
mice
,
and
because
we
saw
no
difference
between
Runx3
-
/
-
CD8
+
CD4
-
SP
and
CD8
+
CD4
+
DP
cells
in
our
previous
experiments
,
we
used
total
Runx3
-
/
-
CD8
+
T
cells
without
further
fractionation
as
recipients
for
retroviral
transduction
.

Indeed
,
T
-
bet
and
Eomes
both
contribute
to
perforin
expression
in
NK
cells
(
8
,
26
)
,
and
Eomes
induces
granzyme
B
as
effectively
as
T
-
bet
in
developing
Th2
cells
(
7
)
;
thus
,
the
relative
roles
of
these
T
-
box
transcription
factors
vary
depending
on
cell
type
.

Surprisingly
,
however
,
Eomes
and
T
-
bet
appeared
nonredundant
in
their
ability
to
induce
two
other
markers
of
CTL
function
,
Prf1
and
Gzmb
(
Fig
.
4
C
)
.

Because
conventional
Eomes
-
deficient
mice
die
before
precursor
cells
can
be
isolated
for
bone
marrow
transfers
(
27
)
and
because
T
cells
conditionally
deficient
in
Eomes
have
only
recently
been
described
(
9
)
,
we
were
unable
to
introduce
Runx3
into
Eomes
-
deficient
CD8
+
T
cells
to
test
formally
whether
Eomes
cooperated
with
Runx3
to
induce
perforin
expression

administration
,
independent
of
PKA
activation
.

However
,
the
reported
beneficial
effects
of
PTX
are
not
only
related
to
the
downregulation
of
TNF
-
alphabut
also
to
PTX
'
s
hemorrheologic
properties
,
its
ability
to
reduce
neutrophil
activation
,
and
its
beneficial
effects
on
microcirculation
,
cardiac
performance
,
and
organ
injury
.
20
-
25
Herein
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
downregulatory
effects
of
PTX
in
human
mononuclear
cells
involves
modulation
of
pathways
that
involve
NF
-
kappaB
and
CREB
,
two
major
transcription
factors
involved
in
the
inflammatory
cascade
.

This
allows
the
transcription
factor
to
bind
to
promoter
regions
of
specific
pro
-
inflammatory
genes
and
influence
transcription
.
27
,
28
Because
a
number
of
potential
kappaB
sites
are
present
in
the
nucleotide
sequences
of
the
TNF
-
alpha
gene
,
NF
-
kappaB
is
considered
to
be
a
critical
transcriptional
factor
involved
in
TNF
-
alpha
gene
expression
and
protein
synthesis
.
29
,
30

This
hypothesis
is
currently
under
investigation
in
our
laboratory
.

Furthermore
,
we
utilized
a
broad
PKA
inhibitor
in
this
study
in
addition
to
H89
,
but
did
not
examine
the
effect
of
specific
inhibition
of
various
PKA
isoforms
.

Therefore
,
PTX
may
serve
as
a
potential
adjunct
therapeutic
for
the
treatment
of
conditions
in
which
TNF
-
alpha
production
plays
a
significant
role
.

The
relative
amounts
of
IL
-
10
and
IFN
-
gamma
produced
by
Th1
cells
may
influence
the
balance
between
clearance
and
persistent
infection
with
certain
pathogens
(
Moore
et
al
.
,
2001
;
Trinchieri
,
2007
)
,
thus
determining
whether
chronic
infection
or
immunopathology
ensues
.

Again
,
IL
-
10
-
producing
Th1
cells
were
differentiated
at
the
high
antigen
dose
in
the
presence
of
IL
-
12
in
DO11
.
10
T
cells
(
Figure
2A
)
.

High
antigen
dose
and
IL
-
12
cooperated
to
induce
maximal
IL
-
10
production
(
Figures
4A
and
4B
)
,
given
that
this
combination
resulted
in
the
highest
numbers
of
IL
-
10
-
producing
Th1
cells
.

As
in
the
APC
-
driven
cultures
,
stronger
TCR
stimulation
together
with
IL
-
12
led
to
higher
percentages
of
cells
producing
both
IL
-
10
and
IFN
-
gamma
after
1
week
of
culture
(
Figure
5C
)
.

Our
demonstration
that
loss
of
IL
-
2
is
accompanied
by
production
of
IL
-
10
offers
potential
additional
mechanisms
whereby
effector
T
cell
responses
may
be
dampened
during
chronic
disease
.

Although
IL
-
10
may
be
differentially
regulated
in
Th1
and
Th2
cells
as
has
been
reported
(
Chang
et
al
.
,
2007
;
Wang
et
al
.
,
2005
)
,
some
studies
suggest
the
existence
of
common
pathways
,
but
the
molecular
basis
for
these
is
as
yet
unclear
.

That
c
-
maf
expression
is
common
to
IL
-
10
-
producing
Th1
,
Th2
,
and
Th17
cells
and
,
like
IL
-
10
,
is
dependent
on
ERK
activation
in
Th1
and
Th17
cells
for
its
expression
is
of
interest
because
c
-
Maf
has
been
shown
to
be
an
essential
transcription
factor
for
IL
-
10
expression
in
macrophages
(
Cao
et
al
.
,
2005
)
.

With
regard
to
the
expression
of
IL
-
10
by
Th1
cells
,
our
data
provide
a
mechanism
for
how
IL
-
10
expression
is
induced
and
then
amplified
and
regulated
by
the
levels
of
antigen
and
IL
-
12
encountered
in
the
environment
.

At
day

or

,
cells
were
restimulated

and
anti

or

.

After

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
role
of
the
transcription
factors
,
AP
-
1
and
NF
-
kappaB
,
in
IL
-
6
and
CXCL8
regulation
in
Jurkat
T
-
cells
.

Phorbol
myristate
acetate
(
PMA
)
exposure
resulted
in
an
up
-
regulation
of
AP
-
1
and
down
-
regulation
of
NF
-
kappaB
activity
,
however
,
exposure
to
heat
killed
(
HK
)
Escherichia
.
coli
MG1655
resulted
in
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
NF
-
kappaB
activity
without
affecting
AP
-
1
.

Using
an
NF
-
kappaB
activation
inhibitor
,
we
observed
complete
inhibition
of
IL
-
6
expression
while
CXCL8
levels
only
decreased
by
40
%
at
the
highest
concentration
.

Treatment
of
Jurkat
T
-
cells
with
PMA
in
the
presence
of
JNK
-
inhibitor
suppressed
both
CXCL8
and
IL
-
6
while
PKC
-
inhibitor
primarily
decreased
CXCL8
expression
.

Cytokines
and
chemokines
are
important
in
immune
cell
recruitment
and
in
regulation
of
inflammatory
responses
[
1
]
.

The
time
-
dependent
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
by
HK
E
.
coli
was
assessed
further
using
the
optimal
concentration
obtained
from
figure
2b
and
showed
that
the
NF
-
kappaB
activity
increased
after
3
h
of
exposure
(
figure
2c
)
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
PMA
was
120
-
fold
more
effective
at
inducing
CXCL8
than
HK
E
.
coli
.

PMA
-
dependent
induction
of
AP
-
1
and
down
-
regulation
of
NF
-
kappaB
suggests
an
involvement
of
AP
-
1
in
CXCL8
regulation
.

Wang
and
colleagues
[
37
]
reported
an
elevated
inflammatory
response
by
obtaining
expression
of
IL
-
6
following
the
exposure
of
T
-
cells
to
peptidoglycan
.

The
assessment
of
Jurkat
T
-
cell
inflammatory
responses
(
Table
1
)
revealed
an
enhanced
IL
-
2
expression
upon
exposure
to
PMA
or
HK
E
.
coli
due
to
PKC
activation
[
40
]
.

HK
E
.
coli
treatment
resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
of
IL
-
10
expression
.

The
time
course
analysis
of
cytokine
expression
showed
a
correlation
between
AP
-
1
and
the
chemokine
CXCL8
where
CXCL8
expression
was
significantly
elevated
already
at
2
-
6
h
after
PMA
exposure
.

These
observations
indicate
that
the
MAPK
pathway
and
the
transcription
factor
AP
-
1
play
an
important
role
in
the
induction
of
inflammatory
responses
in
Jurkat
T
-
cells
[
12
,
20
,
22
]
.

Expression
of
il
-
6
dropped
below
basal
levels
following
inhibition
of
NF
-
kappaB
and
JNK
whereas
cxcl8
remained
elevated
above
basal
levels
(
16
.
5
-
fold
and
7
.
1
-
fold
respectively
)
following
the
same
treatment
.

Furthermore
,
inhibition
of
PKC
did
not
result
in
a
significant
decrease
of
il
-
6
or
cxcl8
,
which
is
in
accordance
with
protein
data
(
figure
6
)
.

Activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
in
Jurkat
T
-
cells
is
dependent
on
Bcl10
activation
,
which
in
turn
is
regulated
by
PKC
.

Down
-
regulation
of
Bcl10
from
signals
transduced
via
the
TCR
/
CD28
and
PKC
resulted
in
a
concomitant
down
-
regulation
of
NF
-
kappaB
.

In
HIV
infected
persons
,
serum
CXCL8
levels
are
elevated
and
this
could
recruit
more
T
-
cells
potentially
leading
to
a
more
rapid
progression
of
the
disease
since
there
will
be
more
T
-
cells
available
to
infect
.

Furthermore
,
the
CXCL8
release
was
down
-
regulated
by
inhibition
of
JNK
activity
.

Jurkat
T

cells
(
wild

and
TCR

)
were
maintained
in

and
incubated
in
a

of

at

.

The
cells
were
pre

with

,
JNK
and
PKC

and
stimulated
in

with

of

and
Calcium

.

The
cells
were
further
centrifuged
at

g
,
4degreesC
for
10
min
and
the
supernatants
were
transferred
to
new

.

Transfection
of

cells
was
performed
using
luciferase

containing

elements
.

(
n

)
.

(
A
)
CXCL8
expression
was
partially
inhibited
following
PMA
stimulation
(
grey
bars
)
,
whereas
the
levels
were
not
altered
following
stimulation
with
HK
E
.
coli
(
black
bars
)
,
this
indicates
an
induction
mainly
regulated
by
AP
-
1
.

Statistical
significance
from
the
positive
control
(
PMA
)
was
determined
using
Student
'
s
t
-
test
.

CD40
engagement
results
in
the
formation
of
a
receptor
-
associated
complex
that
mediates
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
,
stress
-
activated
protein
kinases
,
and
other
signaling
molecules
.

Known
components
of
the
CD40
signaling
complex
include
members
of
the
TNF
receptor
-
associated
factor
(
TRAF
)
family
of
proteins
.

To
determine
the
role
of
HOIP
in
CD40
signaling
,
we
used
somatic
cell
gene
targeting
to
generate
mouse
B
cell
lines
deficient
in
HOIP
.

We
found
that
the
CD40
-
induced
upregulation
of
CD80
and
activation
of
germline
immunoglobulin
epsilon
transcription
were
defective
in
HOIP
-
deficient
cells
.

CD40
signaling
is
activated
in
a
T
cell
-
dependent
manner
,
as
the
ligand
for
CD40
,
CD154
,
is
expressed
primarily
by
activated
T
cells
.

Similarly
,
the
CD40
and
IL
-
4
driven
production
of
germline
transcripts
from
the
immunoglobulin
epsilon
heavy
chain
locus
,
an
event
that
precedes
immunoglobulin
gene
rearrangement
and
isotype
switching
,
was
defective
in
the
absence
of
HOIP
.

Together
,
our
results
indicate
that
HOIP
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
activation
of
signaling
pathways
that
regulate
cellular
responses
to
CD40
engagement
.

This
cell
line
has
been
particularly
useful
in
the
characterization
of
CD40
signaling
mechanisms
due
to
the
relative
ease
with
which
its
genome
can
be
modified
by
homologous
recombination
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
,
[
9
]
.

To
enable
us
to
confirm
that
any
signaling
or
functional
defects
observed
in
HOIP
-
deficient
cells
were
due
to
disruption
of
the
Rnf31
gene
,
both
HOIP
-
deficient
cell
lines
were
transduced
with
a
retrovirus
encoding
FLAG
-
tagged
wild
-
type
HOIP
,
thus
restoring
HOIP
protein
expression
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.

To
begin
evaluating
potential
contributions
of
HOIP
to
CD40
signaling
,
we
assayed
the
upregulation
of
CD80
induced
by
engagement
of
CD40
on
parental
A20
.
2J
,
HOIP
-
deficient
,
and
HOIP
-
reconstituted
cells
(
Fig
.
2
)
.

In
contrast
,
upregulation
of
CD80
was
restored
in
HOIP
-
reconstituted
cells
,
confirming
that
the
defect
in
CD80
upregulation
in
the
HOIP
-
deficient
cells
was
due
to
the
disruption
of
Rnf31
.

This
process
,
known
as
immunoglobulin
class
switching
(
or
isotype
switching
)
,
allows
B
cells
,
initially
expressing
IgM
,
to
switch
to
IgA
,
IgG
,
or
IgE
depending
on
the
class
of
antibody
most
appropriate
for
a
particular
immune
response
.

It
follows
that
HOIP
is
likely
a
key
mediator
of
CD40
signaling
.

Therefore
,
we
determined
whether
the
association
of
HOIP
with
CD40
in
A20
.
2J
cells
was
altered
by
treatment
of
cells
with
an
inhibitor
of
cIAP
activity
,
a
membrane
-
permeable
peptide
derived
from
the
apoptosis
regulator
SMAC
[
15
]
.

However
,
at
least
one
band
of
significantly
higher
molecular
weight
remained
after
phosphatase
treatment
,
suggesting
that
CD40
-
associated
IKKgamma
is
subject
to
at
least
one
other
modification
in
addition
to
phosphorylation
.

Our
results
indicate
that
the
protein
HOIP
is
critical
for
CD40
-
induced
signals
that
regulate
B
cell
function
.

Expression
of
GLepsilon
in
each
sample
was
normalized
to
the
expression
of
Hprt1
.

Images
of
blots
were
recorded
with
a
low

light
imaging
system
(
LAS4000

and
on

were
washed
with
lysis
buffer
to
remove

.

Material
eluted
from
the
beads
was
fractionated
by
SDS

PAGE
and
transferred
to
PVDF
membranes
for
Western

.

Homologous
recombination
of
the
vector
with

resulted
in

To

SHARPIN

by

The
endogenous

of
Sharpin
mRNA
in
BMDC
was
determined
by
quantitative
real
time
-
PCR
(
qRT
-
PCR
)
following
culture
in
medium
only
or
after
stimulation
with
LPS
.

CD11c

and
MHC
II
+
with
low
expression
of
co
-
stimulatory
molecules
CD40
,
CD80
,
and
CD86
.

Incubation
with
the
TLR
agonists
for
24
hours
resulted
in
increased
expression
of
CD40
,
CD80
,
and
CD86
on
BMDC
;
however
,
there
was
no
difference
in
the
expression
levels
of
these
markers
between
WT
and
cpdm
BMDC
(
Fig
.
2B
)
.

The
present
report
showed
that
null
mutations
of
the
mouse
Sharpin
gene
did
not
affect
the
steady
-
state
distribution
of
splenic
DC
subsets
nor
the
development
and
phenotype
of
BMDC
.

Such
'
sterile
'
inflammation
could
be
initiated
and
take
place
in
all
organs
and
tissues
affected
in
cpdm
mice
,
thus
causing
multi
-
organ
inflammatory
disorders
.

This
hypothesis
is
supported
by
several
recent
studies
.

Combined
with
the
dramatic
effect
of
IL12
treatment
on
the
phenotype
of
these
mice
[
5
]
,
this
suggests
that
the
Th2
-
biased
systemic
inflammation
in
cpdm
mice
is
caused
by
reduced
IL12P70
production
from
DC
.

The
importance
of
IL12P70
in
regulating
Th1
and
Th2
immune
responses
in
mice
was
clearly
demonstrated
in
IL12P35
-
and
IL12P40
-
deficient
mice
[
38
]
,
[
39
]
and
through
clinical
studies
in
human
patients
[

-
[

.

However
,
selective
inhibition
of
NF

kappaB
activation
in
parenchymal
cells
of
the
skin
,

results
in

Members

play
central
roles
in

[

.

All
experiments
in
this
study
were
performed
under

free
conditions
as
FCS
has
been
shown
to
interfere
with
BMP

[

(
own

)
.

Human
B
cells
express
BMP

receptors

Ramos
cells
expressed
the
type
I
receptors
Act
-
RIA
,
weakly
BMP
-
RIB
and
the
type
II
receptor
BMP
-
RII
,
but
more
weakly
than
normal
B
cells
(
Figure

)
.

HL60
cells
were
used
for
comparison
and
weakly
expressed
Act

RIA
and
BMP
-
RII
.

Upon
ligand
binding
,
the
type
II
receptor
transphosphorylates
and
activates
the
type
I
receptor
.

Type
I
receptors
can
signal
via
several
pathways
.

The
BMP
-
6
induced
phosphorylation
was
high
at
the
earliest
time
point
tested
(
15
minutes
)
,
and
remained
high
for
at
least
48
hours
(
Figure
5
)
.

The
amount
of
Id1
-
Id4
mRNA
was
quantified
by
real
-
time
RT
-
PCR
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
Id1
could
be
a
possible
target
gene
for
mediating
the
effects
of
BMP
-
6
in
human
B
cells
,
whereas
Id2
and
Id3
not
seem
to
be
involved
.

Additionally
,
BMP
-
6
induced
cell
death
in
CD27
+
memory
B
cells
as
well
as
in
a
Burkitt
lymphoma
cell
line
(
Ramos
)
.

Importantly
,
the
anti
-
proliferative
effect
of
BMP
-
6
could
be
completely
neutralized
by
the
use
of
a
natural
inhibitor
,
Noggin
.

Other
members
of
the
BMP
-
family
have
also
been
reported
to
induce
apoptosis
,
including
in
mouse
B
lineage
cells
[
26
]
.

The
antiproliferative
and
death
inducing
effect
of
BMP
-
6
in
B
cells
with
concomitant
upregulation
of
Id1
protein
is
therefore
in
line
with
the
view
that
Id
proteins
are
required
for
the
induction
of
growth
arrest
and
apoptosis
in
B
-
lymphocyte
progenitors
by
TGF
-
beta
[
40
]
.

Altogether
,
these
results
point
to
an
important
role
for
Id
proteins
in
the
regulation
of
normal
B
cell
homeostasis
and
in
diseases
,
where
B
cells
are
involved
.

We
analysed
the
expression
BMP
-
6
mRNA
in
peripheral
blood
B
cells
by
real
-
time
PCR
,
and
report
here
the
upregulation
of
endogenous
BMP
-
6
transcripts
after
stimulation
with
FCS
,
human
AB
-
serum
and
,
most
importantly
,
anti
-
IgM
.

The
upregulation
of
the
BMP
-
6
-
transcripts
after
IgM
-
crosslinking
is
of
pathophysiologic
interest
[
12
]
.

One
well
recognized
source
for
BMP
-
6
production
is
the
human
bone
and
bone
marrow
stroma
[
51
,

.

BMP
-
6
mRNA
has
been
demonstrated
in
murine
macrophage
cell
lines
,
but
not
in
humans
[
54
]
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
provide
a
rationale
to
further
examine
the
role
of
BMP
-
6
signalling
in
normal
B
cell
biology
as
well
as
in
pathologic
conditions
like
B
cell
malignancies
and
autoimmune

were

and

:

PCR
conditions
were
the
same
as
for
the
A3G
promoter
sequence
,
with
the
exception
that
annealing
temperature
was
decreased
to
55degreesC
.

Forty
-
eight
hours
after
transfection
,
HeLa
cells
were
harvested
for
detection
of
Sp1
and
Sp3
proteins
.

Further
confirmation
of
the
specificity
of
these
DNA

protein
complexes
was
demonstrated
by
the
inability
of
the
unlabeled

Sp1

3mut
probe
to
abolish
binding
(
Figure

,
lanes
12
and

)
.

In
order
to
characterize
the
complexes
,
we
performed
supershift
experiments
using
Sp1
-
and
Sp3
-
specific
antibodies
.

Silencing
of
Sp1
and
Sp3
reduces
A3G
promoter
activity

Thus
,
the
induction
we
observed
was
most
likely
mediated
by
the
described
interferon
-
responsive
elements
.

The
transcriptional
potency
of
the
GC
-
box
was
further
demonstrated
by
cloning
it
upstream
of
an
SV40
promoter
.

This
resulted
in
a

fold
enhanced
transcription
rate
.

In
addition
,
the
binding
of
Sp1
and
Sp3
to
the
endogenous
A3G
promoter
was
demonstrated
by
a
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assay
.

This
can
be
explained
by
the
remaining
low
amounts
of
Sp1
/
Sp3
proteins
which
can
be
seen
in
the
western

analysis

In

and
in
regulating
cell

during

[

.

Another
recently
proposed

is

,
a
small

involved
in

DT40

,
and
as

we
have
recently

and
the

.

Recently
,
it
was
shown
that
T
-
bet
directly
modulates
GATA3
function
,
suggesting
that
transcription
factors
compete
in
the
early
differentiation
phase
of
T
cells
,
potentially
integrating
environmental
signals
to
finally
imprint
the
T
cell
phenotype
[
4
,
5
]
.

Naturally
occurring
,
thymus
-
derived
Treg
(
nTreg
)
cells
are
generated
in
the
thymus
and
are
assumed
to
protect
against
the
activity
of
autoreactive
T
cells
in
the
periphery
.

These
induced
Treg
(
iTreg
)
cells
were
reported
to
express
FOXP3
[
10
]
.

The
exact
mechanisms
of
iTreg
generation
are
unclear
,
but
T
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
triggering
has
been
shown
to
induce
FOXP3
expression
and
suppressive
cells
in
human
[
11
,
12
]
,
however
the
phenotype
appears
to
be
of
transient
nature
[
13
,
14
]
.

In
contrast
,
Th2
cells
stimulated
under
the
same
conditions
did
not
increase
FOXP3
expression
.

Th2
cells
are
known
to
produce
IL
-
4
upon
activation
,
which
may
interact
with
TGF
-
beta
signaling
and
thus
prevent
FOXP3
induction
.

Low
levels
of
GATA3
were
induced
also
in
the
absence
of
IL
-
4
,
as
it
was
previously
observed
[
3
]
.

Of
note
,
GATA3
was
also
induced
in
the
presence
of
TGF
-
beta
at
high
IL
-
4
concentration
(
Figure
5A
and
5B
)
.

The
IL
-
4
-
mediated
prevention
of
FOXP3
expression
was
not
caused
by
interferences
of
the
receptor
signaling
,
because
the
phosphorylation
of
SMAD2
or
STAT6
was
not
affected
by
the
addition
of
IL
-
4
and
/
or
TGF
-
beta
,
which
demonstrates
that
IL
-
4
as
well
as
TGF
-
beta
signaling
were
functional
under
these
conditions
(
Figure
5C
)
.

Increasing
amounts
of
IL
-
4
increase
intracellular
GATA3
,
whereas
FOXP3
decreased
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
mRNA
analysis
(
Figure
5D
)
.

In
conclusion
,
IL
-
4
negatively
regulates
the
natural
or
inducible
Treg
cell
turnover
not
only
in
vitro
but
also
in
vivo
.

In
fact
both
populations
showed
similarly
enhanced
proliferation
(
Figure
6A
)
.

The

the

.

These
mice
develop
lymphomas
at
an
older
age
,
but
signs
of
autoimmune
disease
were
not
described
[
22
]
.

In
contrast
,
naive
T
cells
could
efficiently
up
-
regulate
FOXP3
when
treated
with
TGF
-
beta
to
induce
iTreg
cells
[
10
,
28
-
34
]
,
suggesting
that
FOXP3
plays
an
important
role
in
the
early
differentiation
process
and
may
act
in
a
way
similar
to
that
known
for
the
Th1
/
Th2
decision
factors
T
-
bet
and
GATA3
.

This
commitment
is
characterized
by
competitive
expression
of
these
factors
[
35
,
36
]
,
which
we
also
observed
in
differentiating
FOXP3
+
iTreg
cells
including
a
phase
of
co
-
expression
,
which
turns
into
nonoverlapping
expression
upon
completed
differentiation
.

To
prove
the
inhibitory
effect
of
IL
-
4
on
inducible
or
natural
Treg
commitment
in
vivo
,
we
treated
mice
with
IL
-
4
and
anti
-
IL
-
4
.

In
those
experiments
,
the
concentrations
of
IL
-
4
used
were
low
,
and
as
we
also
observed
,
IL
-
4
at
low
concentration
slightly
enhanced
FOXP3
expression
.

In
fact
,
GATA3
-
inducing
IL
-
4
concentrations
repressed
TGF
-
beta
-
mediated
FOXP3
expression
,
whereas
IL
-
4
as
well
as
TGF
-
beta
signaling
were
intact
.

This
inhibitory
effect
of
GATA3
was
further
confirmed
in
BALB
/
c
transgenic
mice
,
expressing
GATA3
in
T
cells
(
DO11
.
10
:
CD2
-
GATA3
transgenic
mice
)
.

Strikingly
,
the
DO11
.
10
:
CD2
-
GATA3
mice
do
have
peripheral
FOXP3
+
cells
,
which
however
displayed
a
10
%
-
25
%
lower
frequency
compared
to
wild
-
type
DO11
.
10
mice
.

Therefore
,
the
role
of
GATA3
appears
to
be
tissue
specific
and
cannot
be
generalized
.

Site
-
specific
mutation
of
this
site
increased
the
activity
of
the
promoter
constructs
,
thus
revealing
the
repressive
nature
of
this
GATA
element
in
memory
T
cells
,
which
naturally
express
GATA3
,
whereas
no
difference
was
seen
in
naive
T
cells
,
which
do
not
express
GATA3
.

as

(

This

may
be
direct
,
through

for

,
or
secondary
to
an

following

However
,
it
is
likely
that
the

would
be
effective
in

In

by

and
by
a

mechanism
involving
increased

of

,
which

thus

Whereas

have
been
extensively
analyzed
in

,
only

studies
have

Preparation
of
Degraded
Carrageenan

Male
Wistar
rats
(
150
g
average
weight
)
were
housed
under
standard
conditions
and
fed
ad
libitum
with
standard
rodent
laboratory
chow
.

An
additional
group
of
four
rats
were
maintained
on
regular
tap
water
(
control
group
)
.

[
24
]
.

One
unit
of
MPO
activity
corresponds
to
the
degradation
of
1
micromol
of
peroxide
per
minute
at
25degreesC
.

Cell
DNA
content
was
then
analyzed
by
flow
cytometry
using
an
EPICS
XL2
(
Beckman
-
Coulter
)
.

Peripheral
Blood
Monocytes
or
THP
-
1
cells
were
exposed
to
complete
medium
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
carrageenan
for
36
h
.

Biologically
active
TNF
-
alpha
/

tissue
culture
supernatant
was
measured
using
the
WEHI
164
clone
13
-
cell

assay
[

]
.

cDNA
was
generated
on
1
microg
of
total
RNA
in
a
reaction
volume
of
20
microl
,
using
M
-
MLV
reverse
transcriptase
(
Invitrogen
)
.

cDNA
for
TNF
-
alpha
was
amplified
for
35
cycles
using
the
oligos
:
sense

'
-
AAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGT
-

'
and
antisense

'
-
CAGATAGATGGGCTCATACC

'
.

Membranes
were
subsequently
probed
with
the
corresponding
antibody
in
blocking
buffer
,
overnight
.

Histological
examination
revealed
various
degrees
of
mucosal
inflammation
.

These
symptoms
were
totally
absent
in
the
colon
of
control
rats
(
Fig
.
1E
)
.

In
order
to
study
the
effect
of
dCGN
on
the
expression
of
cell
surface
antigens
,
PBM
and
THP
-
1
cells
were
incubated
for
36
h
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
dCGN
.

The
increase
in
surface
ICAM
-
1
expression
and
TNF
-
alpha
production
by
monocytes
correlated
with
an
upregulation
of
mRNA
for
these
molecules
.

These
assays
also
allowed
us
to
determine
what
NF
-
kappaB
subunits
were
activated
by
dCGN
.

In
agreement
with
the
previous
data
,
FACS
analysis
of
nuclei
from
THP
-
1
cells
showed
that
there
was
a
basal
level
of
nuclear
NF
-
kappaB
(
Fig
.
7D
)
.

These
degraded
CGN
may
also
have
a
possible
carcinogenic
effect
[
4
]
,
[
6
]
-
[
8
]
;
however
this
is
still
controversial
.

This
macrophage
accumulation
was
not
due
to
cell
proliferation
because
dCGN
inhibited
THP
-
1
monocytes
proliferation
in
vitro
.

Degraded
CGN
induced
a
robust
production
of
TNF
by
monocytes
.

Surprisingly
,
monocyte
activation
by
dCGN
to
produce
TNF
was
much
stronger
than
the
activation
induced
by
LPS
,
an
inflammatory
factor
considered
to
be
among
the
most
potent
stimuli
for
leukocyte
activation
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
neutralizing
antibody
to
CD14
only
partially
(
<
40
%
)
inhibited
dCGN
-
induced
TNF
secretion
(
not
shown
)
.

Indeed
,
dCGN
induced
NF
-
kappaB
activation
as
shown
by
degradation
of
IkappaBalpha
,
translocation
of
p65
and
p50
sub
-
units
to
the
nucleus
and
by
activation
of
an
NF
-
kappaB
-
responsive
luciferase
reporter
plasmid
.

Such
relationship
between
NF
-
kB
activation
and
cell
cycle
regulation
has
been
reported
in
normal
human
epidermal
cells
[
50
]
.

This
higher
expression
of
ICAM
-
1
resulted
in
formation
of
cell
aggregates
similar
to
those
observed
in
patients
with
Crohn
'
s
disease
.

These
results
suggest
that
,
although
CGN
is
widely
used
as
a
food
additive
,
its
degraded
forms
have
an
important
effect
on
monocytes
characteristic
of
an
inflammatory
phenotype
.

RUNX1
plays
an
important
role
in
hematopoiesis
during

,
and
RUNX3
has
important
functions
in

(

.

To
determine
whether
RUNX1
and
RUNX3
are
also
expressed
in
human

in

,
we

All
three
binding

are
conserved
between
human

and

(

.

Cell
lysates
were
obtained
from
HEK293T
cells
that
had
been
transiently

.

CBFbeta
,

common
cofactor
of
all
RUNX

,
stabilizes
and
increases
the
binding
of
the
runt

to
target
DNA
sequences
.

Even
though
Cbfb

CD4

T
cells
had
impaired
induction
of
Foxp3
after
stimulation
with
anti
-
CD3
/
28
mAbs
and
TGF
-
beta
,
sufficient
numbers
of
Foxp3
+
cells
could
be
generated
to
permit
analysis
of
their
suppressive
activity
.

Cells
were
cultured
under
T

conditions
,
and
then
mixed
with
CFSE
-
labeled
autologous
CD4

T
cells
and
stimulated
with
anti

mAb
.

TGF
-
beta
promotes
or
inhibits
the
proliferation
,
differentiation
,
and
survival
of
a
wide
array
of
different
cells
.

These
data
in
mice
confirm
the
human
data
that
RUNX
proteins
play
an
important
role
for
TGF
-
beta
-
dependent
FOXP3
induction
,
as
well
as
in
the
suppressive
capacity
of
iT
reg
cells
.

Cbfb
-
deficient
nT
reg
cells
progressively
lose
Foxp3
upon
division
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
increased
death
of
Cbfb
-
deficient
nT
reg
cells
in
that
study
.

Polymorphisms
that
alter
RUNX1
binding
to
other
genes
have
also
been
described
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
linkage
at

in
Japanese
patients
(
Tokuhiro
et

and
in

(
Prokunina
et

.
,
2002
;

)
.

Runx
proteins
also
play
an
essential
role
during
T
lymphocyte
differentiation
in
the
thymus
(
Taniuchi
et
al
.
,

.

The
interaction
of
Foxp3
and
NFAT
is
dependent
on
their
cooperative
binding
to
DNA
(

.

In

our
findings
elucidate
the
role
of

IKKbeta
phosphorylation
regulates
RPS3
nuclear
translocation
and
NF
-
kappaB
function
duringEscherichia
coliO157
:
H7
infection

However
,
it
is
unknown
how
RPS3
nuclear
translocation
is
regulated
.

Thus
,
the
IKKbeta
-
dependent
modification
of
a
specific
amino
acid
in
RPS3
promotes
specific
NF
-
kappaB
functions
that
underlie
the
molecular
pathogenetic
mechanisms
of
E
.
coli
O157
:
H7
.

The
best
-
known
mammalian
NF
-
kappaB
subunits
are
Rel
proteins
,
including
RelA
(
p65
)
,
RelB
,
c
-
Rel
,
p50
,
and
p52
(
refs
.
4
,

)
.

We
next
examined
resting
Jurkat
cells
and
detected
a
modest
endogenous
IKKbeta
-
RPS3
interaction
(
Fig
.
1d
)
,
potentially
accounting
for
the
basal
NF
-
kappaB
transcription
required
for
cell
proliferation
and
survival
.

Immunoblotting
of
nuclear
fractions
confirmed
that
full
expression
of
IKKbeta
,
but
not
IKKalpha
,
was
necessary
for
activation
-
induced
RPS3
nuclear
translocation
(
Fig
.
2b
)
.

Consistent
with
this
notion
,
RPS3
association
with
importin
-
alpha
,
but
not
importin
-
beta
,
was
enhanced
in
TNF
-
stimulated
cells
(
Fig
.
3a
)
.

Therefore
,
we
examined
whether
RPS3
binding
to
importin
-
alpha
is
essential
for
nuclear
translocation
during
NF
-
kappaB
activation
.

We
discovered
that
GST
-
RPS3
could
be
phosphorylated
by
IKKbeta
,
but
not
IKKalpha
,
in
vitro
(
Fig
.
4a
,
compare
lanes
4
and
7
)
.

Phosphorylation
of
RPS3
and
its
NF
-
kappaB
function

While
expressing
RPS3
S209A
had
no
impact
on
p65
nuclear
translocation
,
it
substantially
attenuated
p65
recruitment
(
Fig
.
5e
)
.

There
was
no
significant
Flag
-
RPS3
or
p65
recruitment
to
ACTB
promoter
lacking
kappaB
sites
(
Fig
.
5e
)
,
suggesting
the
recruitment
was
kappaB
site
-
specific
.

Thus
,
the
recruitment
of
RPS3
as
well
as
the
contingent
recruitment
of
p65
to
key
promoters
depended
on
S209
.

In
uninfected
cells
,
TNF
-
treatment
stimulated
a
~
7
-
fold
increase
in
RPS3
S209
phosphorylation
,
peaking
at
30
minutes
(
Fig
.
6d
)
.

Indeed
,
these
genes
were
only
modestly
upregulated
in
cells
infected
with
wild
-
type
E
.
coli
O157
:
H7
,
but
significantly
induced
in
cells
infected
with
either
deltanleH1
or
deltaescN
strains
(
Fig
.
6e
)
.

In
contrast
,
deleting
nleH1
had
no
impact
on
the
expression
of
RPS3
-
independent
genes
,
including
CD25
and
TNFSF13B
(
Supplementary
Fig
.
12
)
.

Piglets
infected
with
deltanleH1
displayed
clinical
disease
consistent
with
a
robust
inflammatory
response
,
but
with
reduced
bacterial
colonization
and
little
diarrhea9
.

To
examine
whether
the
kinase
activity
is
required
for
NleH1
to
inhibit
IKKbeta
phosphorlyation
of
RPS3
on
S209
,
we
ectopically
expressing
either
wild
-
type
or
K159A
NleH1
in
293T
cells
.

RPS3
nuclear
accumulation
was
substantially
retarded
by
infecting
cells
with
wild
-
type
E
.
coli
O157
:
H7
(
Fig
.
7d
)
.

The
bacterial
effector
NleH1
specifically
binds
to
RPS3
once
injected
into
host
cells
and
profoundly
suppresses
NF
-
kappaB
and
its
attendant
protective
immune
responses9
.

These
data
provide
new
insights
into
the
poorly
understood
action
mechanism
for
most
T3SS
effectors
.

By
selectively
inhibiting
RPS3
and
its
attendant
NF
-
kappaB
function
with
NleH1
,
the
pathogen
achieves
the
ability
to
increase
colonization
and
diarrhea
yet
limiting
the
mortality
of
the
host
.

Consistently
,
the

started

5
min
,
and
turned
off
at
30
min
independently
of
the
presence
of
Tat
(
Figure

)
.

These
results
indicated
that
the
arginine
-
rich
domain
of
Tat
was
involved
in
the
binding
to
IkappaB
-
alpha
,
which
was
consistent
with
previous
observations
(
50
,
51
)
.

The
transcriptional
regulation
of
MIP
-
1alpha
has
been
poorly
characterized
.

By
ChIP
,
Tat
bound
to
the
NF
-
kappaB
-
responsive
promoters
,
and
not
to
the
GAPDH
and
ACTB
promoters
,
with
loss
of
binding
following
p65
RNA
interference
(
Figure
5I
)
,
suggesting
that
Tat
occupancy
occurred
via
p65
interaction
.

Based
on
the
evidence
that
Tat
enhanced
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
p65
subunit
of
NF
-
kappaB
(
49
,
63
,
64
)
,
and
physically
interacted
with
the
IkappaB
-
alpha
repressor
(
50
,
51
)
,
we
investigated
the
possibility
that
Tat
could
activate
NF
-
kappaB
via
direct
interaction
with
IkappaB
-
alpha
and
p65
.

Several
inflammatory
cytokines
under
the
transcriptional
control
of
NF

kappaB
are
hyper

expressed
in

Hematopoeitic
cells
appear
to
be
the
predominant
source
of
inflammasome
-
induced
pro
-
inflammatory
IL
-
1beta
in
CF
.

PBMCs
derived
from
CF
subjects
display
preserved
inflammasome
activation
and
IL
-
1beta
secretion
in
response
to
the
major
CF
pathogen
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
.

In
CF
,
airway
epithelial
cells
have
been
shown
to
produce
an
exaggerated
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokine
response
to
stimulation
[
4
]
,
[
5
]
.

CD14
positive
monocytes
from
CF
patients
and
healthy
controls
showed
a
significant
increase
in
caspase
-
1
activation
upon
stimulation
with
LPS
+
ATP
,
PAO1
,
and
LPS
+
Poly
(
dA
:

)
(
Fig
.
4a
)
but
this
activation
was
not
different
between
CF
and
control
subjects
(
Fig
.
4b
)
.

Dependency
of
these
responses
on
NF
-
kappaB
was
confirmed
by
pharmacologic
inhibition
of
NF
-
kappaB
using
the
Bay11
-
7082
inhibitor
of
IkappaBalpha
phosphorylation
,
which
significantly
reduced
NF
-
kappaB
/
AP
-
1
activation
(
P
<

.

)
(
Fig
.

)
and
the
subsequent
production
of
IL
-

(
P

)
(
Fig

)
and

.
001
)
(
Fig
.
6f
)
in
response
to
both
heat
-
killed
and
live
PAO1
.

Overall
these
results
confirm
that
NF
-
kappaB
is
an
important
modulator
of
IL
-
1beta
production
and
that
increased
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
augments
inflammasome
-
mediated
production
of
IL
-
1beta
.

To
determine
whether
CFTR
dysfunction
alters
IL
-
1beta
production
,
THP
-
1
cells
and
PBMCs
from
CF
patients
and
healthy
controls
were
treated
with
the
CFTR
inhibitor
,
CFTRinh172
,
prior
to
simulation
with
live
P
.
aeruginosa
.

Cells
deficient
in
CFTR
are
thought
to
exhibit
an
increased
basal
level
of
NF
-
kappaB
activity
,
which
leads
to
increased
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokine
production
including
an
increased
availability
of
pro
-
IL
-
1beta
for
cleavage
and
secretion
.

However
,
as
monocytes
and
other
PBMCs
express
CFTR
[
50
]
,
[
51
]
and
produce
large
amounts
of
IL
-
1beta
,
they
are
adequate
models
to
examine
the
effects
of
CFTR
function
on
IL
-
1beta
production
.

Furthermore
,
we
find
little
evidence
to
support
an
increased
IL

inflammatory
response
to
NF
-

The

have
been
identified
as
a
family
of

can
act
in

loops
,

their
roles
as
the
mediators

have

The
continuing

the

of

through
cell
surface
signaling
by
means
of

CD69

as
well
as
the

of

as

and

The

of

were
determined
by

were

by
the

of

As

Similarly
,
IL

production
was
not

(

.

Taken
together
,
these
results
indicate
that
RA
CD4
+
T
cells
become
less
susceptible
to
the
immunoregulatory
effect
of
IL
-
10
during
the
active
phase
.

Increased
expression
of
cell

IL

on

IL

plays
a
critical
role
in
cellular
responses
to
IL

[

.

Defective
IL
-
10
-
mediated
STAT3
phosphorylation
in
RA
CD4

T
cells

STAT3
phosphorylation
was
augmented
only
when
activated
by
as
much
as
10
ng
/
ml
IL
-
10
.

Since
IL
-
6
is
also
abundant
in
sera
of
active
RA
patients
,
frequently
detected
at
>
1
ng
/
ml
[
27
]
,
we
examined
whether
persistent
exposure
of
CD4
+
T
cells
to
high
concentrations
of
IL
-
6
in
the
blood
circulation
was
responsible
for
their
sustained
STAT3
activation
and
resistance
to
IL
-
10
inhibition
in
active
RA
.

Normal
CD4
+
T
cells
were
thus
incubated
for
20
min
with
culture
medium
containing
30
%
serum
from
active
RA
patients
and
neutralizing
anti
-
IL
-
6
antibody
or
control
antibody
,
and
STAT
phosphorylation
was
examined
by
western
blot
analysis
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
found
that
PB
CD4
+
T
cells
from
patients
with
active
RA
,
in
the
presence
of
IL
-
10
,
are
able
to
produce
higher
levels
of
IFN
-
gamma
after
CD3
and
CD28
costimulation
than
normal
CD4
+
T
cells
.

This
impaired
IL
-
10
signaling
is
probably
induced
by
chronic
exposure
to
immune
complexes
in
vivo
,
because
both
cell
surface
IL
-
10R1
expression
and
IL
-
10
-
induced
Jak1
activation
are
suppressed
in
IFN
-
gamma
-
primed
macrophages
by
a
protein
kinase
C
-
dependent
pathway
following
ligation
of
the
IgG
Fc
gamma
receptor
[
14
]
.

In
addition
,
the
involvement
of
other
essential
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
this
process
was
suggested
by
our
preliminary
experiments
demonstrating
that
IL
-
10
-
mediated
IFN
-
gamma
inhibition
in
CD4
+
T
cells
was
reduced
by
pretreatment
with
IL
-
1beta
and
TNF
-
alpha
,
although
less
effectively
than
by
IL
-
6
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Furthermore
,
IFN
-
gamma
and
IL
-
10
produced
by
CD4
+
T
cells
themselves
could
be
responsible
for
impaired
IL
-
10
signaling
in
the
ST
,
because
T
-
cell
infiltrates
produce
both
cytokines
[
34
,
35
]
.

The
T
-
cell
-
inhibitory
effect
of
IL
-
10
may
therefore
be
modulated
complicatedly
upon
exposure
to
an
inflammatory
environment
in
RA
joints
,
where
many
cytokines
are
present
substantially
[
10
]
.

More
recently
,
high
levels
of
activated
STAT3
,
thought
to
be
induced
mainly
by
IL
-
6
,
have
been
detected
in
the
ST
,
and
STAT3
activation
has
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
synovial
fibroblast
proliferation
and
IL
-
6
production
[
37
]
.

Furthermore
,
the
significance
of
persistent
STAT3
signaling
in
Th1
-
cell
-
dominated
autoimmune
arthritis
has
been
suggested
by
studies
of
the
gp130F759
/
F759
mice
,
in
which
the
Src
homology
phosphatase
-
2
binding
site
of
gp130
(
the
transmembrane
glycoprotein
beta
subunit
of
the
IL
-
6
family
cytokine
receptor
)
,
tyrosine
759
,
was
mutated
to
phenylalanine
[
39
]
.

Increased
SOCS1
expression
in
RA
CD4
+
T
cells
may
therefore
be
associated
with
both
the
impaired
responsiveness
to
IL
-
10
and
to
IL
-
10
-
mediated
STAT3
activation
,
and
defective
SOCS3
expression
may
be
responsible
for
persistent
STAT3
activation
in
response
to
serum
IL
-
6
.

IL
-
12
-
induced
STAT4
activation
is
inhibited
by
SOCS3
induction
in
Th2
cells
,
whereas
IL
-
4
-
induced
STAT6
signaling
is
diminished
by
SOCS1
induction
in
Th1
cells
.

More
specific
therapy
targeting
STAT3
activation
will
be
awaited
;
for
example
,
the
induction
of
the
SOCS3
gene
,
the
efficacy
of
which
has
been
demonstrated
in
animal
models

be

in

Statistical
analysis

Because
RA
PBMC
include
several
cell
types
in
addition
to
T
cells
,
some
inflammatory
cytokines
released
from
macrophages
and
other
lymphocytes
might
have
affected
the
production
of
IL
-
17
from
T
cells
.

The
calcineurin
inhibitors
cyclosporin
A
and
FK506
also
downregulated
the
IL
-
17
secretion
as
well
as
the
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
p38
inhibitor

,
whereas

is

by

+
T
cells
,
especially
for
Th1
/
Th0
cells
,
not
the
Th2

[

.

In
view
of
the
fact
that
NF

kappaB
was
also
activated
by
anti
-
CD3
/
anti
-
CD28
,
IL
-
15
or
mitogens
in
our
experiments
,
it
is
most
likely
that
the
NF
-
kappaB
pathway
is
also
actively
involved
in
the
induction
of
IL
-
17
in
RA
PBMC
.

pronounced
production

in

Erythropoiesis

In
mice
,
erythropoiesis
originates
in
the
embryonic
yolk
sac
where
primitive
erythroid
cells
express
epsilony
and
betah
-
1
globins
[
22
]
.

In
addition
to
playing
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
[
8
-
11
]
,
cartilage
[
6
,
12
,
13
]
,
and
muscle
[
14
,
15
]
,
it
was
shown
that
Sox6
is
upregulated
in
long
-
term
hematopoiesis
stem
cells
(
LT
-
HSC
)
compared
with
multipotent
progenitors
of
adult
mouse
bone
marrow
lineage
[
28
]
.

The
epsilony
globin
gene
was
initially
identified
as
an
upregulated
transcript
in
the
p100H
mouse
using
subtractive
hybridization
to
identify
Sox6
downstream
targets
.

These
data
indicate
that
Sox6
acts
to
repress
the
epsilony
promoter
at
the
transcriptional
level
.

Deletion
analysis
of
the
epsilony
promoter
,
as
shown
in
Figure
2C
,
defined
a
region
(
-
63
to
-
37
)
within
the
epsilony
proximal
promoter
that
is
critical
for
Sox6
repression
.

Analysis
of
this
short
region
reveals
two
Sox
/
Sox6
consensus
binding
sites
[
5
]
(
Figure
3A
)
.

The
36
-
bp
probe
was
shifted
by
the
tagged
Sox6
protein
.

Consistent
with
the
EMSA
results
,
the
mutant
epsilony
promoter
reporter
constructs
(
with
either
one
or
both
Sox
/
Sox6
binding
sites
mutagenized
)
do
not
result
in
significant
promoter
repression
in
transfection
studies
(
Figure
3F
)
.

Thus
,
both
sites
are
required
for
maximal
repression
of
epsilony
by
Sox6
,
but
not
to
the
same
degree
.

Figure
4
shows
that
the
epsilony
proximal
promoter
is
readily
immunoprecipitated
with
Sox6
antibody
in
both
MEL
cells
and
liver
cells
.

The
above
data
(
Figures
3
and
4
)
clearly
indicate
that
Sox6
acts
as
a
repressor
of
the
epsilony
gene
by
directly
binding
to
the
epsilony
promoter
,
probably
as
a
dimer
.

Furthermore
,
in

hybridization
shows
that
Sox6
is
highly
transcribed
in
12

that

is

factor
in
the

mechanism
of
globin
genes
.

The
rats
were
assigned
randomly
to
three
groups
:
normal

(

without
any

)
,
normal

(

control
)
and
intra

group
(

.

Five
rats
in
each
group
at
each
time
point
were
sacrificed
by
over
dose
injection
of
Ketamine
.

Rats
were
anesthetized
with
intra

peritoneal
sodium
pentobarbital
(
60
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
primary
antibody
employed
was
rabbit
anti
-
TLR4
(
WuHan
,
BA1717
)
.

The
biotinylated
secondary
antibody
and
antibody
-
biotin
-
avidin
-
peroxidase
complexes
(
ABC
reagent
,

were
obtained
from

Cellular

were
prepared
from

cerebral

,
electrophoresed
with
SDS
-
polyacrylamide
gel
and
transferred
onto
Hybond
ECL
membranes
(

)
.

A
super
shift
assay
using
antibodies
to
P65
and
P50
was
performed
to
confirm
NFkappaB
binding
specificity
as
previously
described
.

In
the
saline
control
group
,
the
TLR4
mRNA
slightly
increased
,
but
was
not
significantly
different
from
normal
group
.

To
explore
the
distribution
of
TLR4
protein
,
the
TLR4
was
detected
by
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
.

.

The
mortality
of
ICH
is
higher
than
that
of
ischemic
stroke
.

However
,
how
the
inflammatory
responses
is
activated
and
regulated
in
the
brain
tissue
after
ICH
is
unclear
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
established
the
rat
model
of
experimental
ICH
and
detected
the
TLR4
mRNA
and
protein
.

Activation
of
TLR4
stimulates
IkappaBalpha
phosphorylation
and
degradation
,
resulting
in
nuclear
translocation
of
NFkappaB
,
which
initiates
transcription
of
genes
associated
with
innate
immune
responses
and
inflammation
[

,

]
.

Infiltration
of
cells
of
the
innate
and
adaptive
immune
system
into
the
joint
space
drives
the
local
production
of
proinflammatory

1
and
T

type
17
cytokines
,
chemokines
,
and
matrix
metalloproteinases
by
infiltrating
monocytes
and
synovial
cells
.

In
addition
,
TNF
and
IL
-
1
are
themselves
very
potent
activators
of
NF
-
kappaB
(
reviewed
in
[

)
.

TNF
and
IL
-
1
are
both
very
potent
activators
of
NF
-
kappaB
and
it
can
be
expected
that
NF
-
kappaB
activation
by
these
cytokines
mediates
most
of
their
pro
-
inflammatory
activities
in
RA
(
reviewed
in
[

)
.

NF
-
kappaB
proteins
are
sequestered
in
the
cytoplasm
as
latent
complexes
by
inhibitory
proteins
referred
to
as
inhibitor
of
NF

kappaB
(
IkappaB
)
proteins
,
which
prevent

TRIF
also
recruits
TRAF6
[
25

and
RIP1
[

via
a
direct
interaction
.

Recently
,
the
disruption
of
interactions
between
E2
ubiquitin
conjugating
enzymes
(
Ubc13
and
Ubc5hc
)
and
E3
ubiquitin
ligases
(
TRAF6
,
TRAF2
and
cIAP1

)
were
described
as
another
important
mechanism
used
by
A20
to
downregulate
NF
-
kappaB
signalling
[
42
]
.

Interestingly
,
A20
expression
is
itself
regulated
by
NF
-
kappaB
[
50
]
,
implicating
A20
in
the
negative
feedback
regulation
of
NF
-
kappaB
signalling
.

Recently
,
Elsby
and
colleagues
functionally
evaluated
in

the
regulatory
ability
of
RA
-
associated
SNP
variants
on
A20
promoter
activity
,
and
could
show
repressed
A20
transcription
for
some
of
the
SNPs
investigated
[

.

Mice
with
a

of

cells
,
however
,
show
attenuated
responses
to
secondary
stimulation
by
TRAF2
-
dependent
factors
,
suggesting
a
positive
regulatory
role
in
these
cells
.

Moreover
,
miR

155
was
shown
to
promote
TNF
production
,
a
key
process
in
the
pathogenesis
of
RA
[
87
]
.

In
addition
,
given
the
number
of
miRNAs
in
humans
and
the
multiple
mRNAs
they
target
,
intense
complexity
can
be
expected
.

miR

is
thought
to
negatively
regulate
TLR

by
inhibiting

Deficiency

Protects
against

Virus
Infection

Here
we
used
myeloid
cell
specific
A20
knockout
mice
to
examine
the
role
of
the
ubiquitin
-
editing
protein
A20
in
the
response
of
myeloid
cells
to
IAV
infection
.

The
presence
of
viral
nucleic
acids
,
such
as
viral
RNA
and
DNA
,
viral
replication
intermediates
and
viral
transcription
products
,
can
be
sensed
by
specific
intracellular
PRRs
[

]
.

Emergence
of
drug
-
resistant
strains
of
influenza
viruses
with
pandemic
potential
underscores
the
importance
of
developing
novel
antiviral
strategies
.

TLR3
and
RIG
-
I
have
been
implicated
as
sensors
of
IAV
infection
[
10
]
-
[
12
]
.

In
addition
,
well
characterized
ubiquitin
ligases
such
as
TRAF6
[
25
]
,
[
26
]
and
TRAF3
[
27
]
mediate
respectively
NF
-
kappaB
and
IRF3
activation
upon
RIG
-
I
stimulation
.

A20
is
an
ubiquitin
-
editing
enzyme
belonging
to
the
OTU
-
domain
family
of
DUBs
.

Interestingly
,
A20
also
harbors
atypical
zinc
finger
dependent
K48
-
specific
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
activity
.

Unlike
IRF3
,
IRF7
is
not
or
weakly
expressed
under
naive
conditions
and
IRF7
protein
levels
are
rapidly
upregulated
upon
virus
-
induced
IRF3
activation
[
54
]
,
[
55
]
.

As
expected
,
poly
(
I
:
C
)
transfection
induced
the
rapid
expression
of
A20
in
wild
type
,
but
not
in
A20myel
-
KO
BMDM
(
figure
1B
,
upper
panel
)
.

To
test
whether
A20
directly
controls
IAV
-
induced
gene
expression
in
alveolar
macrophages
,
we
isolated
these
cells
from
lungs
of
A20myel
-
KO
and
control
littermates
and
infected
them
in
vitro
with
IAV
X
-
47
.

Consistent
with
the
higher
KC
and
MIP
-
2
levels
in
A20myel
-
KO
mice
,
the
number
of
neutrophils
(
CD11b
+
Ly6C
+
Ly6G
+
F4
/
80
-
)
that
were
recruited
in
the
bronchoalveolar
spaces
upon
IAV
infection
was
clearly
higher
throughout
infection
in
A20myel
-
KO
mice
compared
to
control
animals
(
figure
3D
)
.

A
clear
increase
in
CD8
+
T
cells
could
be
detected
at
day
7
and
10
post
infection
,
but
no
differences
were
observed
between
A20myel
-
KO
and
wild
type
mice
(
figure
S2A
and
figure
S2C
)
.

This
was
associated
with
a
selective
enhancement
of
neutrophil
recruitment
to
the
bronchoalveolar
compartment
,
and
resulted
in
improved
viral
clearance
later
on
during
infection
.

However
,
the
selective
effect
of
A20
deficiency
on
neutrophil
recruitment
,
without
altering
inflammatory
monocyte
(
Ly6C
+
CD11b
+
)
recruitment
,
further
support
the
idea
that
monocytes
and
not
neutrophils
are
major
contributors
to
IAV
-
associated
immunopathology
and
lethality
[
78
]
.

However
,
this
does
not
exclude
an
additional
effect
of
A20
on
other
signaling
pathways
that
may
contribute
to
proinflammatory
gene
expression
.

In
this
context
,
it
was
recently
shown
that
A20
cooperates
with
the
ubiquitin
-
binding
proteins
TAX1BP1
and
ABIN1
to
to
disrupt
the
TRAF3
-
TBK1
-
IKKepsilon
complex
,
thereby
negatively
affecting
K63
-
polyubiquitination
of
TBK1
and
IKKepsilon
,
and
their
ability
to
activity
IRF3
[
81
]
,
[
82
]
.

The
identification
of
these
substrates
will
be
the
topic
of
future
investigations
in
our
laboratory
.

Also
small
compound
inhibitors
of
A20
might
be
an
interesting
alternative
.

All
efforts
were
made
to
ameliorate
suffering
of
animals
.

To
determine
pulmonary
viral
titers
,
median

was
measured
as

Status

)
induces
severe
vasogenic
edema
in
the
piriform
cortex
(
PC
)
accompanied
by
neuronal
and
astroglial
damages
.

SE
was
induced
by
pilocarpine
in
rats
that
were
intracerebroventricularly
infused
with
saline
-
,
and
soluble
TNF
p55
receptor
(
sTNFp55R

prior
to
SE

.

SE
also
induces
severe
vasogenic
edema
in
the
PC
accompanied
by
neuronal
and
astroglial
damages
[
5
-

]
.

The
vasogenic
edema
results
from
dysfunction
of
endothelial
cells
and
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
.

Loss
of
BBB
integrity
is
not
only
due
to
an
abrupt
increase
in
the
intraluminal
pressure
but
also
influenced
by
the
properties
of
cerebral
tissue
.

Animal
protocols
were
approved
by
the
Institutional
Animal
Care
and
Use
Committee
of
Hallym
University
.

In
addition
,
we
have
made
all
efforts
to
minimize
the
number
of
animals
used
and
their
suffering
.

Rats
were
divided
into
two
groups
:
vehicle
(
saline
)
-
treated
and
soluble
TNFp55

(

-
treated

.

Three
days
after

,
rats
were
treated
with
pilocarpine
(

.

The
rats
were
then
observed
3
-
4
hours
a
day
in
the
vivarium
for
general
behavior
and
occurrence
of
spontaneous
seizures
.

Immunohistochemistry

For
negative
controls
,
rat
hippocampal
tissues
were
incubated
with
1
mug
of
the
antibody
that
was
preincubated
with
1
mug
of
purified
peptide
for
1
hr
at
room
temperature
or
incubated
with
pre
-
immune
serum
instead
of
the
primary
antibody
.

For
nuclei
counterstaining
,
we
used
Vectashield
mounting
medium
with
DAPI
(
Vector
,
Burlingame
,
CA
)
.

In
our
previous
[
18
,
25
]
and
preliminary
data
,
neuronal
damage
was
first
detectable
at
3
days
after
SE
.

An
optical
fractionator
was
used
to
estimate
cell
numbers
.

The
optical
fractionator
(
a
combination
of
performing
counting
with
the
optical
dissector
,
with
fractionator
sampling
)
is
a
stereological
method
based
on
a
properly
designed
systematic
random
sampling
method
that
by
definition
yields
unbiased
estimates
of
population
number
.

One
day
to
1
week
after
SE
,
both
TNFp55R
and
TNFp75R
immunoreactivities
were
significantly
reduced
in
astrocytes
,
not
in
endothelial
cells
,
due
to
massive
astroglial
loss
(
data
not
shown
)
[
5
,
7
,
8
,
20
]
.

In
contrast
,
p65
-
Thr435
phosphorylation
was
increased
in
endothelial
cells
(
not
astrocytes
)
within
the
PC
of
saline
-
infused
animals
12
hr
after
SE
(
Figure
5A
)
.

Furthermore
,
neutrophil
infiltration
showed
a
direct
proportion
to
the
area
of
vasogenic
edema
,
with
a
linear
coefficient
of
correlation
of
0
.
8631
(
p
<
0
.

,
Figure

)
.

Therefore
,
our
findings
indicate
that
SE
-
induced
neutrophil
infiltration
into
the
PC
may
be
correlated
to
TNF
-
alpha
-
mediated
vasogenic
edema
formation
.

MIP
-
2
is
a
powerful
chemokine
that
contributes
to
recruitment
of
neutrophils
[
27
]
.

p65
phosphorylation
of
NF
-
kappaB
enhances
its
transactivation
potential
,
and
p65
phosphorylation
occurs
in
either
the
cytoplasm
or
the
nucleus
[
30
]
.

Indeed
,
neutralization
of
SMI
-
71
in
vivo
leads
to
widening
of
intercellular
junctions
between
endothelial
cells
and
swelling
of
perivascular
astrocytic
processes
[
34
]
,
although
SMI
-
71
is
not
localized
at
endothelial
cell
junctions
[
35
-
38
]
.

Furthermore
,
sTNFp55R
infusion
effectively
inhibited
p65
-
Ser276
and
p65
-
Ser311phosphorylation
in
astrocytes
following
SE
.

Neutrophil
infiltration
into
brain
parenchyma
is
transiently
observed
during
the
acute
phase
of
SE
(
4
-
36
hr
after
SE
)
and
disappears
thereafter
[

.

In
the
PC
,
however
,
neither
a
P2X7
receptor
agonist
/
antagonist
nor
IL

Following
decapitation
,
the

were
dissected
out
,

the

The

demonstrated
that

induced
the

of

and

of

Our
previous
study
has
proved
the
augmentation
of
Nrf2
in
brain
tissue
after
TBI
[
17
]
.

Enhanced
level
of
Nrf2
activates
transcription
of
a
group
of
antioxidant
genes
,
such
as
heme
oxygenase
-
1
(
HO
-
1
)
and
NAD
(
P
)
H
:
quinone
oxidoreductase
-
1
(
NQO1
)
,
which
would
subsequently
reduce
the
damage
in
brain
[
18
]
.

Postinjury
administration
of
SFN
,
an
inducer
of
Nrf2
,
significantly
improves
spatial
memory
of
rat
and
decreases
the
immunoreactivity
for
4
-
Hydroxynonenal
(
4
-
HNE
)
,
a
marker
of
lipid
peroxidation
,
in
the
cortex
and
the
CA3
subfield
of
hippocampus
after
TBI
[
19
]
.

In
view
of
the
fact
that
Nrf2
is
a
transcription
factor
which
should
take
function
mainly
in
nucleus
,
it
can
be
reasoned
that
astrocytes
may
be
one
kind
of
respondent
cells
in
activation
of
Nrf2
-
ARE
pathway
after
TBI
.

In
conclusion
,
depletion
of
Nrf2
induced
the
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
and
the
expression
of
TNF
-
alpha
,
IL
-
1beta
,
IL
-
6
,
and
MMP9
resulting
in
more
cell
deaths
in
astrocytes
after
scratch
injury
.

Thus
,
the
innate
immune
response
to
MTb
infection
induces
NFAT5
gene
and
protein
expression
,
and
NFAT5
plays
a
crucial
role
in
MTb
regulation
of
HIV
-
1
replication
via
a
direct
interaction
with
the
viral
promoter
.

These
findings
also
demonstrate
a
general
role
for
NFAT5
in
TLR
-
and
MTb
-
mediated
control
of
gene
expression
.

Furthermore
,
inflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
produced
by
the
human
host
in
response
to
MTb
infection
activate
signal
transduction
pathways
in
CD4
T
cells
and
monocytic
cells
that
also
result
in
transcriptional
activation
of
the
HIV
-
1
LTR
[
4
]
-
[
6
]
.

Notably
,
HIV
-
1
comprises
several
subtypes
,
and
the
LTR
of
each
subtype
is
unique
with
respect
to
the
number
and
organization
of
activator
binding
sites
.

By
contrast
,
HIV
-
1
subtypes
C
and
E
,
which
have
spread
disproportionately
in
TB
-
burdened
sub
-
Saharan
Africa
and
southeast
Asia
,
have
three
and
one
NF
-
kappaB
binding
sites
,
respectively
[

,
[
28
]
-
[

.

passed

(

.

As
shown
in

,
stimulation
with

significantly
increased

levels
at

(

and

,
whereas

did
not
increase
NFAT5

levels
(
Figure

)
.

As
shown
in
Figure

,
transfection
of
the

for
NFAT5
reduces
NFAT5
mRNA
levels
in
both
MTb

(

.

We
also
created
a
double
NF
-
kappaB
site
mutant
virus
(
HIV

-

+

)
in
order
to
test
the
impact
of
complete
disruption
of
NF
-
kappaB
binding
to
the
HIV
-
1
LTR
on
MTb
regulation
.

However
,
recombinant
NFAT5
binding
to
the
single
and
the
double
NF
-
kappaB
mutant
LTRs
was
not
impaired
and
indeed
appeared
enhanced
(
compare
lanes
2
-
5
to
lanes
7
-
20
of
Figure
3D
)
.

None
of
the
mutations
completely
abolished
viral
induction
by
MTb
co
-
infection
.

However
,
the
replication
of
each
mutant
virus
was
impaired
to
a
more
significant
extent
in
the
context
of
MTb
co
-
infection
,
consistent
with
important
roles
for
both
NF
-
kappaB
and
NFAT5
in
MTb
-
induced
HIV
-
1
replication
.

Subtype
C
LTRs
generally
have
three
functional
NF
-
kappaB
sites
in
their
LTRs
,
and
subtype
C
is
the
predominant
viral
subtype
in
the
African
and
Asian
HIV
-
1
epidemics
where
MTb
co
-
infection
is
extremely
common
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
,
[
28
]
,
[
52
]
.

We
thus
next
extended
our
analysis
of
the
role
of
NFAT5
in
MTb
/
HIV
-
1
co
-
infection
to
a
subtype
C
isolate
.

To
begin
to
decipher
the
cellular
mechanisms
underlying
NFAT5
-
dependent
,
MTb
-
induced
HIV
-
1
replication
,
we
next
investigated
the
requirement
for
specific
signaling
molecules
in
the
TLR
pathway
that
are
required
for
MTb
stimulation
of
NFAT5
gene
expression
.

The
adaptor
molecule
MyD88
transmits
signals
upon
TLR2
ligation
(
reviewed
in
[
53
]
)
.

Thus
,
MTb
regulation
of
NFAT5
is
dependent
upon
MyD88
.

Indeed
,
in
response
to
hypertonic
stress
,
NFAT5
binds
to
the
aldose
reductase
(
AR
)
promoter
and
induces
rapid
hyperacetylation
of
histones
H3
and
H4
[
76
]
.

Furthermore
,
we
have
shown
that
MTb
stimulation
of
NFAT5
depends
on
TLR
pathway
signaling
molecules
,
including
MyD88
,
IRAK1
,
and
TRAF6
.

We

A

of

in

systems
[

.

For
example
,
the

,
a
key
cellular
target
of
JNK
activity
,
was
one
of
the
hits
in
the
genome
wide
siRNA
screen
[

]
.

We
found
that
the
Akt
pathway
serves
as
a
critical
link
between
RIP1
kinase
and
JNK
activation
in
L929

.

It
has
been
established
that

undergo
necroptotic

death
following
stimulation
with
TNFalpha
[

,
[

.

To
understand
the
activation
of
Akt
and
JNK
under
necroptotic
conditions
,
we
examined
the
changes
in
Akt
and
JNK
phosphorylation
at
9
hrs
post

,
activation

followed

.

TNFalpha
treatment
caused
an
early
and
robust
increase
in
the

and
c

.

Secondly
,
we
saw
that
the
ability
of
the

to
protect
cells
from

rapidly
declined
after
6
hrs

In
the
case

we
occasionally
observed

rather
than
an
increase
in

(

comparing
Fig

and

)
,
suggesting
that
phosphorylation
events
in
addition
to
Thr24
take
place
during
necroptosis
.

We
found
that
inhibition
of
mTORC1
by
rapamycin
,
an
inhibitor
of
the
mTOR
co
-
factor
Raptor
[

]
,
protected
cells
from
necroptosis
(

.

RIP1
kinase
,
Akt
,
mTORC1
and
JNK
control
the
upregulation
of
TNFalpha
accompanying

.

have
recently
reported
that
the
induction
of

by

in
L929
cells
is
associated
with
increased
synthesis
of
TNFalpha
,
which
potentiates
cell
death
.

.

Further
analysis
suggested
that
both
Akt
and
mTORC1
contribute
to
the
upregulation
of
TNFalpha
mRNA
during
necroptosis
as
both
small
-
molecule
inhibition
and
siRNA
knockdown
of
Akt
and
mTOR
reduced
TNFalpha
mRNA
levels
in
necroptotic
cells
(

)
.

Knockdown
of
Akt
isoforms
Akt1
and

or

prominently
suppressed

dependent
increase
in
JNK
and
c

Jun

(
Fig

suggesting
that
Akt
may
provide
a
link
between
RIP1
and
JNK
activation
.

Expression
of
Constitutively

Akt
,

Necroptosis
Under
Serum
Free
Conditions

Constitutively
active
Akt1
(
Myr
-
Akt
)
was
generated
as
previously
described
[
37
]
by
the
addition
of
a
myristoylation
signal
which
provides
constitutive
localization
to
the
plasma
membrane
and
by
the
deletion
of
the
auto
-
inhibitory
PH
domain
(
Fig
.
7A
)
resulting
in
an
Akt
that
is
active
under
serum
free
.

This
allowed
us
to
examine
the
effects
of
other
Akt
mutations
on
necroptosis
.

As
expected
,
the
S473D
mutant
,
which
was
phosphorylated
on
Thr308
after
the
addition
of
zVAD
,
displayed
only
slightly
reduced
activity
,
while
S473A
was
significantly
less
active
in
all
aspects
of
necroptosis
.

Our
model
,
based
on
these
results
,
is
that
necroptosis
-
specific
Thr308
phosphorylation
provides
a
critical
link
between
necroptotic
machinery
and
Akt
kinase
,
allowing
Akt
to
phosphorylate
substrates
during
necroptosis
,
promote
TNFalpha
synthesis
,
JNK
activation
and
eventual
cell
death
.

Similar
to
L929
cells
,
a
RIP1
kinase
dependent
increase
in
the
phosphorylation
of
Thr308
on
Akt
occurred
during
necroptosis
(
Fig
.
8B
,
D
,

)
in
these
cell
types
.

It
did
not
,
however
,
lead
to
a
reduction
in
TNFalpha
production
or
cell
death
(
Fig
.
S10C
,
D
,
F
,
G
)
,
suggesting
that
earlier
data
with
SP600125
protection
(
Fig
.

)
could
reflect
off
-
target
effects
of
this
molecule
,
rather
than
JNK
inhibition
.

The
first
input
,
which
is
induced
by
growth
factors
,
leads
to
the
plasma
membrane
localization
of
Akt
.

Expression
of
constitutively
active
membrane
-
targeted
Myr
-
Akt
overcomes
this
requirement
.

One
possibility
is
that
RIP1
kinase
inhibits
a
phosphatase
that
targets
Thr308
.

Furthermore
,
mutating
these
residues
to
Ala
in
Myr
-
Akt
leads
to
the
loss
of
its
ability
to
promote
necroptosis
.

examples
of
mTORC1
-
dependent
regulation
of

stress
[

]
,
the
exact
mechanisms
during
necroptosis
remain
to
be
established
.

Two
recent
papers
showed
that
the
loss
of
control
over
RIP1
/
RIP3
kinase
activities
by
FADD
and
caspase
-

in
epithelial
cells
unleashes
a
feed
forward
cycle
of
necroptosis
and
TNFalpha
production
,
resulting
in
the
development
of
intestinal

in
mice
and
,
possibly
,
in
patients
with
Crohn

Preliminary

certain
small

that
induce
apoptosis
of
many
types

We

discussed
the

In

In

with
the
sequence
of
the

C

effects
on
bladder
cancer
cells
is
not
well
documented
.

Recent
studies
revealed
that
p21WAF1
protects
cells
from
apoptosis
by
arresting
them
in
G1
and
further
binds
to
pro
-
caspase
-
3
,
preventing
its
activation
and
thus
,
inhibiting
the
apoptotic
cascade
.

These
changes
originate
from
increased
peritoneal
surface
area
,
but
the
morphologic
and
molecular
mechanisms
involved
remain
unknown
.

The
biologic
relevance
of
increased
NOS
in
long
-
term
PD
was
demonstrated
by
enhanced
nitrotyrosine
immunoreactivity
and
a
significant
increase
in
vascular
density
and
endothelial
area
in
the
peritoneum
.

Despite
these
suggestive
observations
,
no
formal
proof
is
as
yet
available
for
the
concept
that
angiogenesis
is
a
physiologic
event
that
occurs
all
over
the
mature
mammalian
integument
whenever
hair
follicles
switch
from
resting
(
telogen
)
to
active
growth
(
anagen
)
.

At
other
times
,
both
the
metastases
and
the
primary
tumor
may
spontaneously
regress
without
treatment
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Human
neuroblastoma
cells
and
human
Chang
hepatocytes
are
grown
in
a
noncontact
,
coculture
system
.

All

Previously
we
demonstrated
that

and

could
transform

in

.

RESULTS
:
No
correlation
was
found
between
tumor
prognosis
and
EGFR
,
ICAM

or
Fas
.

All
of
the
4
tumors
that
were
CD40

,
were
stage
I
tumors
,
without
any
evidence
of
regional
or
distant
metastasis
.

The
differences
in
IL

levels
were
unremarkable
.

Pretreatment

were
not
associated
with

.

uPAR
is
also
coexpressed
with
caveolin
and

of
the

.

Onconase
similarly
inhibited

in

while

than
on

.

However
,
it
is
not
sufficient
for
the

To

the
biological
role
of
the
endogenous

inhibitor
thrombospondin

(

during

,
we
subjected

type
mice
to
a
chemical
skin

regimen
.

Although
antibodies
to
PAI
-
1
did
not
affect
the
adhesion
of
HT1080
cells
to
vitronectin
,
the
antibody
to
uPA
reduced
their
attachment
.

The
interaction
of
VEGF
and
its
receptors
at
gene
and
protein
levels
in
neuroblastoma
remains
widely
unknown
.

Whereas
the
ligands
were
increased
in
stages
III
and
IV
,
the
receptors
were
upregulated
in
stage
III
only
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
VEGF
-
A
(
165
)
is
one
of
the
major
angiogenesis
regulators
among
the
ligands
'
family
of
VEGF
,
whereas
its
receptors
KDR
,
and
most
probably
Flt

,
may
contribute
to
a
poor
prognosis
(
angiogenic
)
phenotype
,
as
indicated
by
their
upregulated
MRNA
levels
in
stage
III
neuroblastoma

Granulocyte

has
had
a
major

"
(
SCN
)
,
a
collective
term
referring
to
congenital
,
idiopathic
,
or
cyclic
neutropenia
.

What
was
observed
,
however
,
was
the
multistep
acquisition
of
aberrant
cellular
genetic
changes
in
marrow
cells
from
patients
who
transformed
,
including
activating
ras
oncogene
mutations
,
clonal
cytogenetic
abnormalities
,
and
G

CSF
receptor
mutations
.

Since
congenital
neutropenia
and
SDS
are
inherited
forms
of
bone
marrow
failure
,
G
-
CSF
may
accelerate
the
propensity
for
MDS
/
AML
in
the
genetically
altered
stem
and
progenitor
cells
,
especially
in
those
with
G

and
ras
mutations
(
82
%
and
50
%
of
patients
who
transform

respectively
)
.

Cancer
cells
secrete
soluble

which
can

Reduced

to
increase
VEGF
production
by
induction
of
the

alpha
(
HIF
-

)
.

The
mechanisms
by
which
hypoxic
tumor
environments
induce
HIF

and
VEGF
expression
are
largely
unknown
.

was
made
in
11
AMD
patients
requiring
treatment
of
CNV
,
but
for
whom
other

was
not
appropriate
.

After
acquiring
and
interpreting

and
repositioning
a

In
addition
to
direct
effects
on
mammary
epithelial
cells
,
including
decreased
proliferation
and
induction
of
apoptosis
,
CLA
may
exert
its
effects
indirectly
by
inhibiting
the
differentiation
of
mammary
stromal
cells
to
an
endothelial
cell
type
.

In
contrast
,
pellets
from
the
CLA
-
fed
animals
contained
fewer
infiltrating
cells
,
which
formed
limited
branching
cellular
networks
,
the
majority
of
which
had
collapsed
lumen
and
no
RBCs
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
overexpression
of
TIMP
-
3
can
inhibit
angiogenesis
and
associated
tumor
growth
,
and
that
the
antiangiogenic
effects
of
TIMP
-
3
appear
to
be
mediated
through
the
inhibition
of
functional
capillary
morphogenesis
.

Looking
for
mechanisms
linking
Brn

to
carcinogenesis
,
we
discuss
the
role
of
this
transcription
factor
in
influencing
Bcl

/
p53
antagonism
and
Bcl

/
VEGF
induction
of
tumor
angiogenesis
,
concluding
this
review
with
a
proposal
for
the
oncogenic
nature
of
Brn

.

Keratinocyte

were
isolated
with

was
analyzed
using

.

These
data
suggest
that
c
-
FLIP
may
play
a
critical
role
in
regulating
Fas
-
mediated
apoptosis
in
prostate
cancer
cells
and
that
modulation
of
c
-
FLIP
may
enhance
Fas
signaling
based
therapies
.

Therefore
,
understanding
these
signaling
mechanisms
may
provide
us
with
novel
ways
to
develop
strategies
for
treating
clinical
diseases
induced
by
these

Arteriogenesis
:
the
development

growth
of
collateral

.

The
term
"
arteriogenesis
"
was
introduced
to
differentiate
the
formation
of
collateral
arteries
from
angiogenesis
,
which
mainly
occurs
in
the
ischemic
,
collateral
flow
-

tissue
.

The
contribution
of
ischemia
to
arteriogenesis
is
still
unclear
,
but
arteriogenesis
clearly
can
occur
in
the
absence
of
any
significant
ischemia

To
investigate
the

we
constructed

whose

In

we
applied

revealed
that

was
increased
in

reveals
a
consistently
low
rate
of

,
in
contrast
to
lymphomas
of

mice
which
are
often
highly
apoptotic
.

The
low
apoptosis

is
dominant
in
Runx2

MYC
tumors
,
indicating
that
Runx2
confers
a
potent
survival
advantage
to
MYC

.

Our
results
show
that
Runx2
and
MYC
overcome
distinct
"

"
responses
and
that
their
selection
as
collaborating
genes
is
due
to
their
ability
to
neutralize

Because
failure
of
endothelial

might
lead
to
intimal

,
we
investigated
this
and
other
key
markers
of
vasoactivity
and

in
subjects
with

.

RESULTS
:
The

was
highly
expressed
by
pulmonary

in
all
cases
of

In

,
we
show
that

Consequently
,
we
examined
by
immunohistochemistry

Treatment
with
the
combination
of
1B3
and

mice
resulted
in
tumor
regression
in
58
%
of
mice
compared
to
that
in
18
%
of
mice
treated
with
DC101
alone
.

We
show
that
HIF
-
1alpha
and
VEGF
are
increased
through
A3
adenosine
receptor
stimulation
,
whereas
the
effects
on
IL
-

are
mediated
via
the
A2B
subtype
.

There
is
comparatively
less
evidence
to
support
the
use
of
other
treatment
modalities
for
relief
of
symptoms
in
intermittent
claudication
,
but
there
is
considerable
interest
in
therapeutic
angiogenesis
to
promote
new
vessel
formation
and
enhance
collateralisation
of
the
lower
limb
using
recombinant

factor
proteins
or
gene
transfer
strategies
.

In
agreement
,
induced
overexpression
of
VEGF

in
LAPC

enhanced
tumor
lymphangiogenesis
leading
to
the
development
of
metastatic
lesions
.

The
mean
BCVA
increased
from
20

76
to
20

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
Ang1
halts
the
ability
of
VEGF
to
induce
the
phosphorylation

redistribution
of
the
adhesion
molecule
VE
-

,
thereby
rescuing
the

.

RESULTS
:
Bevacizumab

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Intravitreal

can
be
used
to

An
important
role
of
proprotein

in
tumorigenic
processes
has
been
suggested
by
various
studies
.

Moreover
,
the
lymph
nodes
close
to
the
salivary

were
enlarged
,
and

showed
that
they
had

.

Furthermore
,
the
expression
of

aptamers
moderately
reduced
the
growth
of
immortalized

proliferation
,
but
without
affecting
apoptotic
cell
death
.

Moreover
,
the
M2

aptamers
also
reduced
the
proliferation
rate
of
human

.

To
examine
the
mechanism
by
which

whether
acute

)
would
have
long

BACKGROUND
:
M
-
CSF
recruits
mononuclear
phagocytes
which
regulate
processes
such
as
angiogenesis
and
metastases
in
tumors
.

VEGF
is
a
potent
activator
of
angiogenesis
as
it
promotes
endothelial
cell
proliferation
and
new
blood

formation
.

Further
analysis
revealed
that
M

induced
VEGF
through
the
MAPK

ERK
signaling
pathway
via
the
transcription
factor

may
be
more
effective
at

Here
,
we
have
tested
endocytic

for
regulation
of
VEGFR2

linked
to

CONCLUSIONS
:
Rab5a

regulate
VEGFR2

This
suggests
that

METHODS
:
Bovine

were

.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Our
study
provides
new
candidate
genes
for
the

Such

We
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
ERK5

not
only
is
involved
in
EC
survival
and
stress

but
also
controls

EPOX

Our

that

it
a

for

Collectively

our

provide
strong

and
genetic
evidence
of
a
central

for
alpha2beta1
integrin
in
experimental
and
developmental

Because
islet

may
originate
from
endothelial

,
we
assessed
the
expression
of
selected
genes
involved
in
endothelial

activation
in

from
a
spontaneous

of
type

Thus
,
metabolically

In

In

had

.

Multivariate

demonstrated
that

Furthermore
,

Such

Nuclear

contributes
to
the
development
of

thus
leading
to

CONCLUSION
:
The

in

suggests
cross

Expression

.

The
presence
of
bFGF
in
the
extracellular
compartment
of
a
diverse
variety
of
organs
may
play
a
role
in
angiogenesis
.

The
activation
of
Na
+
transport
is
due
to
the
exchange
of
protons
formed
via
glucose
conversion
into
lactate
for
Na
+
,
i
.
e
.
,
to
the
stimulation
of
the
Na
+
/
H
+
-
antiport
.

Experimental
results
and
theoretical
calculations
suggest
that
in
glucose
-
containing
medium
the
Na
+
transport
increases
from
0
.
75
to
1
.
78
pmol
/

per

.

In
synchronized
cultures
at
the
beginning
of
the
mitotic
cycle
,
the
bulk
of
ATP
resynthesized
via
glycolysis
is
utilized
for
the
synthesis
of
biopolymers
,
whereas
that
at
the
end
of
the
S
-
phase
and
in
the
G2
-
phase
is
utilized
for
cation
transport
across
plasma
membranes
.

Metastatic
spread
of
malignant
tumor
appears
to
correlate
with
activation
of
the
fibrolytic
system
.

The
ras
-
encoded
proteins
are
similar
to
regulatory
G
-
proteins
and
are
candidates
for
the
unknown
G
-
protein
that
modulates
phosphatidylinositol
(
PI
)
turnover
.

Ha
-
ras
cells
also
show
less
binding
of
phorbol
ester
than
control
cells
,
suggesting
that
elevation
of
DG
causes
partial
down
-
regulation
in
addition
to
activation
of
protein
kinase
C
.

Epidermal
growth
factor
(
EGF
)
binds
with
high
affinity
and
specificity
to
a
single
site
on
the
external
domain
of
its
transmembrane
receptor
to
activate
the
tyrosine
protein
kinase
activity
of
its
cytoplasmic
portion
.

In
these
conditions
,
the
rates
of
oxygen
uptake
,
the
CO2
evolution
and
the
changes
in
the
redox
states
of
cytochromes
indicate
that
glucose
is
preferred
by
Ehrlich
ascites
tumour
cells
as
energy
substrate
.

In
contrast
,
the
response
of
cells
to
long
-
term
treatment
with
PDBu
was
significantly
different
depending
upon
the
initial
growth
state
of
the
cells
.

cells
and
early

passage
rat
embryonic
fibroblasts
.

The
increased
transport
rate
is
a
consequence
of
an
increased
number
of
transporters
in
the
transformed
cells
.

In
contrast
,
at
least
some
of
these
sites
were
not
methylated
in
DNA
from
the
B

cells
expressing
high
levels
of
DR

mRNA
.

Uncultured
peripheral
blood
T

cells
from
human
T

virus
-
infected
individuals
expressed
DR
antigens
at
a
low
level
,
and
the
DR
alpha
locus
was
partially
unmethylated
.

These
data
thus
indicate
that
the
effects
on
hemostasis
of
the
drugs
examined
can
contribute
only
marginally
to
their
antimetastatic
action
,
since
more
pronounced
effects
on
hemostasis
have
been
shown
to
be
required
to
significantly
affect
metastasis
formation
.

These
data
support
a
possible
role
for
tumor
cell
TGF
-
beta
in
the
progression
of
mammary
carcinomas
by
suppressing
host
immune
surveillance
.

Assays
of
electrophoretic
mobility
,
DNA

binding
specificity
,
and
antigenicity
indicated
that
Stat3
or
a
closely

STAT
family
member
was
constitutively

by
the
Src

The

Furthermore
,
in

,

cleaved
OPN
stimulated
a
greater
rate
of
EC
migration
in

,
which
was
additive
to
the
increased
migration
associated
with
induction
of

Thus
,
these
data
demonstrate
cooperative
mechanisms
for
VPF

regulation
of
EC
migration
involving
the
alphavbeta3
integrin
,
the

and

of

whereas
it
had
no
effect
on

.

It
is
believed
that
the
role
of
the

in

is
to
protect
against

by

was
quantified
as

between
the

by
the

of

.

However
,
high
expression
of
WT1
correlates
with
poor

in
acute

.

This
study
was
aimed
to
investigate
whether
there
is
selective
expression
of
these
cytolytic
markers
in
the
putative
NK
-
cell
lymphomas
and
whether
there
is
correlation
with

in
these
tumors
.

The

also
expressed

other
postthymic

were
consistently

.

Since
both

remained
non

in

,
these
properties
indicate
that
they
attained
a
premalignant

Although
the
importance
of

has
been
shown
in
renal
carcinomas
,
the
contribution
of
these
new

in

is
not
clear
.

We
have
,
therefore
,
measured
the

together
with
their

by

RESULTS
:
In
all
,
67
vascular

were
found
by

by

;
this

.

However
,
in

,
ephrin

did
not
induce

,
probably
due
to
instability
of
the

.

These
results
indicated
that

plays
a
critical
role
in

HYPOTHESIS
:
We
speculate
that
there
is
a
burst

of
distant

after

in
approximately
20
%
of

Vascular

sword
.

However
,
VEGF
has
also
been
shown
to
be
neuroprotective
across
several
experimental
paradigms
,
and
hence
could
potentially
protect
vulnerable
cells
from
damage
associated
with
seizures
.

METHODS
:
Four
hundred

-
four
consecutive

of
446
patients
treated
with

from
January

,
2001

,
were
identified
from

records
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Despite
a
small
sample
size
and
limited
length
of
follow
-
up
,
this
study
shows
that
visual

on
average
can
remain
stable
for
at

12
months
after

of

.

Expression
of

and
netrin

in
normal

and
its
implication
in

carcinogenesis
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
observations
suggest
that
DCC
/
netrin
-
1
signaling
may
commit
cells
to
the
transition
of
endometrial
gland
architecture
or
function
from
a
proliferating
to
a
secretory
phase
.

Group

Enoxaparine
Na
,
group

received
HBO
therapy
,
and
group
4
was
given
both
enoxaparine
Na
and
HBO
treatment
.

Statistically
significant
differences
were
observed
between
groups
1
and
4
and
between
groups
1
and
3
regarding
the
hydroxyproline
content
of
the

.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
and
its
receptors
are
key
regulators
of
the
process
of
angiogenesis
,
which
makes
them
attractive
therapeutic
targets
.

Thrombospondin
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
angiogenesis
and
might
therefore
be
important
in
controlling
tumour
growth
.

To
address
this
question
,
we
used
the
proteomic
approach
of
tandem
affinity
purification
to
identify
cellular
proteins
that
are
in
complex
with
E7
,
and
identified
the
600
-
kDa
protein
,
p600
,
as
a
binding
partner
of
E7
.

Additionally
,
knockdown
of
p600
reduced
transformation
of
cells
expressing
both
BPV
-
1
E6
and
E7
,
as
well
as
E6
alone
,
suggesting
that
the
ability
of
E7
to
transformed
cells
is
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
through
its
ability
to
bind
p600
.

Besides
TGFbeta
and
RTK
/
Ras
signaling
,
autocrine
factors
and
Wnt
-
,
Notch
-
,
Hedgehog
-
and
NF
-
kappaB
-
dependent
pathways
were
found
to
contribute
to
EMT
.

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrate
that
murine
bone
marrow
contains
endothelial
progenitors
,
which
arise
from
a
cell
with
self
-
renewing
capacity
,
and
can
integrate
into
tumor
microvasculature
,
albeit
at
a
very
low
frequency
.

The
c

myc
oncogene
encodes
for
a
transcriptional
factor
involved
in
many
cellular
processes
such
as
proliferation
,
differentiation
and
apoptosis
.

We
defined
the
role
of
c

Myc
in
cancer
cell
sensitivity
to
vinblastine
(
VLB
)
using
human
colon
cancer
cells
:

or
transfected
with
a
plasmid
containing
the
human
c
-
myc
gene
in
antisense
orientation
(
LoVo
-
mycANS
)
.

Moreover
,
the
downregulation
of
c
-
myc
oncogene
by
an
antisense
strategy
might
represent
a
useful
goal
for
improving
the
efficacy
of
this
anti
-
neoplastic
drug
family
.

However
,
in
N
-
ras
-
transformed
cell
clones
,
RA
-
induced
expression
of
these
homeobox
genes
is
delayed
.

The
median
response
duration
was
8
.
2
months
.

Many
studies
on
carcinogenesis
carried
out
early
in
the
last
century
are
united
on
the
consensus
that
cancer
is
a
genetic
disease
.

Recent
advances
in
stem
cell
biology
added
the
new
concept
that
cancer
originates
from
a
single
cancer
-
initiating
cell
.

These
findings
reveal
a
previously
unrecognized
regulatory
role
for
Ang
II
on
sFlt
-
1
expression
in
murine
and
human
pregnancy
and
suggest
that
elevated
sFlt
-
1
levels
in
preeclampsia
may
be
caused
by
a
dysregulation
of
the
local
renin
/
angiotensin
system
.

After
24
h
treatment
with
80
microM
magnolol
in
serum
-
containing
medium
,
about
50
%
of
the
cells
exhibited
apoptotic
features
and
20
%
necrotic
features
.

Furthermore
,
inhibition
of
PARP
activity
,
but
not
of
caspase
activity
,
completely
prevented
magnolol
-
induced
necrosis
,
suggesting
the
notion
that
it
might
be
caused
by
depletion
of
intracellular
ATP
levels
due
to
PARP
activation
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
two
independent
downstream

/
ERK1
/

and
DCN
/
EGFR
/
phosphoinositide

,
mediate

of
transcription

of

such
as

and
increase

Among

OBJECT
:
Endothelial

Bevacizumab
is
a

that
has
been
shown
to
have
activity
in

Blockade
of
angiogenesis
is
an
important
approach
for
cancer
treatment
and
prevention
.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
is
one
of
the
most
critical
factors
that
induce
angiogenesis
and
has
thus
become
an
attractive
target
for
antiangiogenesis
treatment
.

We
found
that
GSE
could
directly
inhibit
the
kinase
activity
of
purified
VEGF
receptor
2
,
a
novel
activity
of
GSE
that
has
not
been
characterized
.

Consistent
with
the
in
vitro
data
,
GSE
treatment
of
tumor
-
bearing
mice
led
to
concomitant
reduction
of
blood
vessel
density
and
phosphorylation
of
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
.

In
the
current
study
,
the
impact
of
VEGF
expression
on
the
response
of
tumors
to
the
VEGFR2
associated
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
vandetanib
was
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:
Vandetanib
treatment
had
no
effect
on
tumor
cell
clonogenic
cell
survival
in

but
doses
>
or
=
10
nM
significantly
reduced
endothelial
cell

.

We

.

We
determined
that

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
the
effect
of
vascular
bundle
implantation
in
autogenous
bone
graft
on
angiogenesis
.

METHODS
:
Thirty

six
New

were
evaluated
in
this
study
.

Each
bone
was
placed
in
masseter
muscle
separately
.

Multiple

,
an
incurable
plasma
cell
malignancy
,
is
characterized
by
altered
cellular
metabolism
and
resistance
to
apoptosis
.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
-
induced
receptor
phosphorylation
is
the
crucial
step
for
initiating
downstream
signaling
pathways
that
lead
to
angiogenesis
or
related
pathophysiological
outcomes
.

Compared
with
CSC
-
low
tumors
,
CSC
-
high
tumors
exhibited
increased
microvessel
density
and
blood
perfusion
and
induced
increased
mobilization
and
tumor
recruitment
of
bone
marrow
-
derived
endothelial
progenitor
cells
(
EPC
)
.

Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
that
tumor
cells
treated
with
antibodies
specific
for
beta
(

)
-
microglobulin
(
beta

molecules
undergo
apoptosis
in

and
in

)
.

However
,
although
beta
(
2
)
M
and
MHC
class
I
are
expressed
on
normal
hematopoietic

,
which
is
a
potential

concern
,
the
monoclonal

were
selective

Our
earlier
studies
showed
that
DATS
induced

in

.

However
,
there
is
no
report
to
show
that
DATS
induced
apoptosis
in

and
inhibited
CT26
cancer
cells
in

on
a
murine

.

Thus
,
DATS
may
represent
a
colon

preventive
agent
and
can
be
used
in
the
future
.

The

of
HMGA2
modulates
the

,
resulting
in
cells
with
enhanced

and
increased
telomere

.

These
findings
are
potentially
clinically
relevant
,
because
HMGA2
expression
is
reported
to
be
upregulated
in
a
number
of
human
cancers
as
telomere
maintenance
is
essential
for
tumorigenesis

High

We
found
that

correlated
positively
with

this

that
a
key

This

was
expressed
on

,
but
exhibited
marked
intratumoral

intertumoral
variability
in
the
proportions
of
positive

and
the
intensity
of

Staining
of
the
normal

,
if
present
,
was
much
lower
than
observed
in
tumor

from
the

In
all
cases
,
the
somatostatin

were
localized

,
where

suppressed
.

Metastasis

5T4
antigen
disrupts

and
induces

.

Thus
,
5T4
molecules
can
deliver
signals
through
both
the
extracellular
and
intracellular
domains
,
and
the
resultant
effects
are
consistent
with
a
role
for
5T4

.

Consequently
,
increased

Although
evidence

,
current
uncertainties

make
it
difficult
to
reach
definitive

The

The
role
of
BRCA1
in
sporadic

ovarian
cancers
remains
elusive
.

We
suggest
that
the
rarity
of
observed
BRCA1
mutations
in
sporadic
breast
and
ovarian

is
due
to
the
greater
likelihood
of
BRCA1

mechanisms
such
as

.

Troponin

,
both
in

and
in

,
and
to
inhibit

of
a
wide
variety
of
tumors
in

.

We
further
support
this
hypothesis
by
providing
the
first
evidence
that
TnI
can
act
on
nonendothelial
as
well
as
endothelial

and
by
demonstrating
that
this

is
specific
for
the

,
suggesting
a

.

Taken
together
,
these
results
show
for
the
first
time
that
active
RhoA
is
able
to
transform
FRTL

cells
and
that
this
effect
is
coupled
to
a
loss
of
thyroid

due
to
impaired

.

RESULTS
:
There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the

Nevertheless
,
patients
who
achieved

(

had
a
significantly
lower
median

compared
to
those
who
did

In

found
to
be

as
a

on
the

of

.

Furthermore
,
the

of
selective
targeting
of
PTEN

cells
by
specific
pharmacologic
inhibitors
of
members
of
the
Pten

up

For
this
reason
,
formalin

In

were
selected
which
showed
a

We
have
investigated
the

in
24
primary

derived
from
renal

,
its

with

and
its

.

CD154

,
significantly
correlated
with

.

Together
,
these
studies
define
a
novel

pathway
activated
by
DNA

that
results
in
down

Furthermore

we
show
that

to
evoke

and
that

there
was

These

that
HIF

functions
as
a
master
regulator
of
angiogenesis
by
controlling
the

The

whether

whether

For
this

was
significantly
increased
and
decreased
as

,
respectively
.

These

are
important
in

RESULTS
:
The

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
have

VEGFR1
-
positive

.

These
findings
demonstrate
a
requirement
for
VEGFR1

in
the
regulation
of

,
and
suggest
that
expression
patterns
of
fibronectin

dictate
organ

We
therefore
set
out
to
determine
whether
the

represent
an

for

Previous

have
shown
that
activation
of
the

plays
an

role
in
leukemogenesis

and

.

The
CCAAT
/
enhancer
-
binding
protein
beta
(
C

EBPbeta
)
transcription
factor
has
been
associated
with
several
cancer
models
.

In
this
study
,
the
expression
of
C
/
EBPbeta
was
analysed
in
a
series
of
90
gastric
carcinomas
(
GCs
)
.

In
normal
gastric
mucosa
,
C
/
EBPbeta
expression
was
restricted
to
cells
in
the
proliferative
zone
.

The

D
organization
of
these
extracellular
components
distinguishes
the
Surgisis
mesh
from
synthetic
materials
and
is
associated
with
constructive
tissue
remodelling
instead
of
scar
tissue
.

Common
features
of
this
ECM
-
assisted
tissue
remodelling
include
angiogenesis
,
recruitment
of
circulating
progenitor
cells
and
constructive
remodelling
of
damaged
tissue
structures
.

The
average
IMVD
had
statistical

(

,
and
analysis
by

,
the
average
IMVD
had
statistical
difference
between
high
and

.

The
effect
of
swainsonine
(
active
compound
of
locoweed
and
a
potential
anticancer
drug
)
on
vascular
development
showed
no
differences
in
sinusoidal
diameters
at
7
weeks
,
but
a
decrease
in
capillary
density
was
noted
.

Strikingly
,
Tip30
deletion
promotes
proliferation
of
primary
MECs
and
results
in
rapid
immortalization
of
MECs
in
vitro
relative
to
wild
-
type
cells
.

Together
,
these
results
suggest
that
Tip30
is
an
intrinsic
and
negative
regulator
of
MEC
proliferation
partly
through
the
inhibition
of
Wisp2
and
Igf
-
1
expression
,
and
its
absence
in
the
mammary
gland
may
predispose
MECs
to
neoplastic
transformation
.

Unlike
wounds
,
however
,
that
turn
off
VPF
production
after
healing
,
tumors
did
not
turn
off
their
VPF
production
and
instead
continued
to
make
large
amounts
of
VPF
,
allowing
malignant
cells
to
continue
to
induce
new
blood
vessels
and
so
to
grow
and
spread
.

The
transforming

factor
beta
(
TGFbeta
)
family
has
critical
roles
in
the

.

Using

,
we
deleted

.

,
and
markedly
impaired

.

These
results
show
a
remarkable

of

Angiogenesis
plays
an
important
role
in
many
types
of
cancer
.

However
,
the
role
of
IL
-
8
in
non
-
Hodgkin

s
lymphoma
(
NHL
)
has
not
been
fully
determined
.

We
developed

in
131
control
individuals
.

The
importance
of
NO
in
the
vasculature
is
demonstrated
by
several
experimental
conditions
,
such
as
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
-
induced
angiogenesis
.

Thus
,
the
NO
metabolic
pathway
in
endothelial
cells
could
be
one
of
the
main
contributing
factors
for
angiogenesis
.

METHODS
:
Transplant
tumor
model
was
induced
by
subcutaneous
inoculation
of
2

(

)
Lewis
lung
cancer
(
LLC
)
cells
into
the
back
of
C57BL
/

mice
.

CONCLUSION
:
Endostatin
gene
therapy
mediated
by
adenoviral
vector
efficiently
induces
expression
of
endostatin
in
vivo
,
and
inhibits
the
growth
and
metastasis
of
tumor
.

This
pathway
will
continue
to
be
a
focus
of
investigation
,
particularly
with
respect
to
targeted
experimental
chemotherapeutics
.

Furthermore
,
we
have
searched
for
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
apoptosis
by
demonstrating
apoptosis
-
related
genes
.

RESULTS
:
Our
results
revealed
that
docetaxel
and
ATRA
were
synergistically
cytotoxic
and
apoptotic
in
DU
-
145
cells
,
in
a
dose
-
and
time
dependent
manner
.

CONCLUSION
:
In
conclusion
,
we
strongly
suggest
that
docetaxel
and
ATRA
combination
is
a
good
candidate
for
this
challenging
era
of
daily
oncologic
practice
.

The
pro

angiogenic
capacities
of
perlecan
that
involve
proliferative

migratory
signals
in
response
to

will
be
explored
,
as
well
as
the
anti

resulting
from
interactions
between
the
C

domain
known
as
endorepellin
and
integrins
that
control
adhesion
of
cells
to
the
extracellular

.

Additional
mechanistic
studies
further
suggested
that
the
ability
of
circulating
cancer
cells
to
extravasate
to
surrounding
lung
tissues
was
linked
to
the
activation
of
the
vascular
endothelium

This

owing
to
its
action
on

and
oxidative

;
however
,
the
specific
metabolic

and
mechanisms
of
3
-
BrPA
action
in
human
hepatocellular
carcinomas
,
particularly
its
effects
on

,
are
poorly
understood
.

The
activity
of
mitochondrial
hexokinase
was
not
inhibited
by
150
microM
3
-
BrPA
,
but
this
concentration
caused
more
than
70
%
inhibition
of
GAPDH
(
glyceraldehyde

-
phosphate
dehydrogenase
)
and
3

phosphoglycerate
kinase
activities
.

The
activity
of
succinate

was
inhibited
by
70
%
by
3

treatment
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
study
identifies
specific
components
of
the
Robo
signaling
apparatus
that
work
together
to
guide
directional

of

,
respectively
.

Newly

were
also
found
to
be

Correspondingly
,
Ang

have
been

to
exert

.

The

was
tested
for
the
antitumor

against
mildly

and
highly
aggressive
renal
cell
carcinoma
.

To
verify
that
P18
acts
in
the
same
manner
as
PEDF
,
we
used
immunohistochemistry
to
measure
PEDF
targets
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor

,
and
CD95
ligand
expression
in
P18

.

RESULTS
:
P14
and
P18
blocked
endothelial

chemotaxis
;
P18
and

.

The
concept
of
the
neurovascular
unit
emphasizes
that
common
signals
and
substrates
underlie
the
physiology
and
pathophysiology
of
neuronal
and
endothelial
compartments
in
brain
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
suggested
that
cisplatin
induced
a
reduction
of
endothelial
cell
migration
through
an
inhibition
of
MMP2
activity
by
downstream
signal

pathways
independent
of

These

One
limitation
of
these

may
be

INTRODUCTION
:
Increased
angiogenesis
in
bone
marrow
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
chronic
myeloid
leukaemia
(
CML
)
,
a
clonal
myeloproliferative
disorder
that
expresses
a
chimeric
bcr
/
abl
protein
.

Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
is
one
of
the
most
potent
and
a
specific
regulator
of
angiogenesis
which
principally
targets
endothelial
cells
and
regulates
several
of
their
functions
,
including
mitogenesis
,
permeability
and
migration
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
this
study
was
the
follow
-
up
of
VEGF
expression
during
the
course
of
CML
.

CONCLUSION
:
Immunohistochemically
confirmed
significance
of
the
expression
of
VEGF
in
dependence
of
the
CML
stage
could
be
of
clinical
importance
in
deciding
on
the
timing
therapy
.

Aberrant
expression
of
Evi
-
1
has
been
frequently
found
in
myeloid
leukemia
,
and
is
associated
with
a
poor
patient
survival
.

Overexpression
of
Evi
-
1
increased
Pbx1
expression
in
hematopoietic
stem
/
progenitor
cells
.

Relevant
differentially
expressed
genes
were
validated
by
either
quantitative
real
-
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
or
immunohistochemistry
on
tissue
microarrays
.

Finally
,
we
identified
FGF13
as
a
new
prognostic
marker
that
predicted
poorer
outcome
in
patients
who
were
clinically
considered
free
from
disease
.

Activity
of
several
transcriptional
factors
located
downstream
in
the
Akt
pathway
was
also
tested
,
and

significance
in

tumor
tissues
is
limited
.

Specimens
of
NSCLC
and
adjacent
normal
lung
tissues
were
collected
from
110
patients
.

The
expression
of

was
upregulated
in
stage

and
their
relations
to

and

.

Evaluation
of
VEGF
expression
level
with
the
same
tissues
was
used
to
establish
the
antigenic
profiles
,
and
the
marker
of
CD34
staining
was
used
as
an
indicator
of
microvessel
density
(
MVD
)
.

The
neural
stem
cell
fate
determinant
TLX
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
neurogenesis
in
the
adult
brain
by
maintaining
neural
stem
cells
.

Increased
TLX
expression
was
observed
in
a
number
of
glioma
cells
and
glioma
stem
cells
,
and
correlated
with
poor
survival
of
patients
with
gliomas
.

We
show
here
that
constitutively
active
STAT3
acts
as
a
master
regulator
of
cell
metabolism
,
inducing
aerobic
glycolysis
and
down
-
regulating
mitochondrial
activity
both
in
primary
fibroblasts
and
in
STAT3
-
dependent
tumour
cell
lines
.

was
associated
with
low

)
.

Low

(
P
=

.
003
)
or
combined
with
methylation
(
P

)
was
associated
with
poor

.

Multikinase

of

.

To
examine
the
mechanisms
underlying
the

,
we
investigated
the
role
of

,
in

in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

This
induction
was
due
to
activation
of
autophagic
flux
,
as
there
was
further
increase
in
LC3
-
II
expression
upon
treatment
with
lysosomal
inhibitors
,
clear
decline
of
the
autophagy
substrate
p62
,
and
an
mRFP
-
GFP
-
LC3
fluorescence
change
in
sorafenib
-
treated
hepatoma
cells
.

Concomitant
inhibition
of
autophagy
may
be
an
attractive
strategy
for
unlocking
the
antitumor
potential
of
sorafenib
in
HCC
.

These
results
suggest
that
desensitization
of
certain
agonist
-
induced
inositol
phospholipid
responses
in
ras
-
transformed
cells
is
a
consequence
of
increased
cell
proliferation
and
associated
amplification
in
C
-
kinase
activity
and
is
an
indirect
consequence
of
transformation
by
ras
.

Because
AR
-
ARD1
interaction
facilitated
the
AR
binding
to
its
targeted
promoters
for
gene
transcription
,
we
propose
that
ARD1
functions
as
a
unique
AR
regulator
and
forms
a
positive
feedback
loop
for
AR
-
dependent
prostate
tumorigenesis
.

Although
AID
activity
is
focused
at
Immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
gene
loci
,
it
also
targets
a
wide
array
of
non
-
Ig
genes
including
oncogenes
associated
with
lymphomas
.

However
,
the
frequency
of
the
p
.
Val600Lys
mutation
was
higher
than
in
most
other
studies
and
comprised
almost
one
-
third
of
all
BRAF
mutations
in
our
cohort
(
27
/
89
,
30
%
)
.

The
virus
-
altered
cells
continued
to
proliferate
in
the
presence
of
high
levels
of
extracellular
calcium
but
exhibited
alterations
in
normal
keratinocyte
terminal
differentiation
that
appear
to
be
specific
to
the
particular
oncogene
.

The
'
angiostatic
'
steroids
17
hydroxyprogesterone
and
epicortisol
were
tested
because
of
their
lack
of
glucocorticoid
and
mineralocorticoid
effects
and
their
structural
similarity
to
glucocorticoids
.

The
mutant
which
retains
only
the
central
region
of
the
v
-
fos
protein
(
Met111
-
Ile206
)
have
both
activities
,
but
the
mutants
which
have
deletions
in
this
region
,
and
one
of
the
mutants
that
has
a
four
amino
acid
insertion
in
it
,
lost
both
activities
.

The
direct
addition
of
all
-
trans
-
RA
to
conditioned
medium
had
no
effect
on
secreted
collagenase
activity
.

The
apparent
molecular
weights
of
the
collagenolytic
enzymes
were
determined
by
electrophoresis
of
cell
extracts
and
concentrated
conditioned
medium
in
type
IV
collagen
-
embedded
polyacrylamide
gels
followed
by
renaturation
and
activation
of
the
enzymes
within
the
gels
.

These
two
enzymes
were
also
found
to
have
specificity
for
gelatin
.

The
results
suggest
that
in
this
strain
,
the
malate
-
citrate
shuttle
is
not
an
effective
pathway
for
transferring
glycolytic
reducing
equivalents
from
cytosol
to
mitochondria
.

Moreover
,
in
the
presence
of
glucose
,
the
malate
-
citrate
cycle
did
not
appear
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
glutaminolytic
process
.

These
results
suggest
that
there
is
cell
type
specificity
for
oncogene
activation
during
in
vitro
rat
bladder
transformation
initiated
by
a
single
carcinogen
and
that
ras
gene
activation
is
not
a
necessary
step
in
urothelial
transformation
in
vitro
.

As
in
prior
studies
,
there
were
significant
vascular

differences
between
DMBA

bearing
cheek
pouches
.

Now
,
by
competition
experiments
with
a
panel
of
different
unlabelled
cells
we
show
that
the
VCSA
expressed
on
RSV
-
transformed
hamster
fibroblasts
is
a
complex
of
at
least
three
distinct
antigenic
specificities
:
(

)
one
expressed
on
all
RSV
-
transformed
fibroblasts
,
regardless
their
species
and
the
subgroup
or
strain
of
the

;
(

one

reacting
with

antigen
(

)
expressed
at

degrees

but
not
on

;
(

present
only
on

In

represents
the

of
a

of

for
the

of

These

the

of

The
end

in
individuals

is
immunosuppression

with
increased

.

Endothelialization
was
present
at
anastomotic
sites
,
but
other
areas
were
covered
with
fresh

.

Such
cases
may
be
considered
either
examples
of
a
single
primary
carcinoma
with
metastasis
or
as
synchronous
primary
neoplasms
.

The
distinction
between
these
two
possibilities
is
made
based
on
clinicopathologic
observations
,
and
therefore
may
not
be
definitive
.

Molecular
biology
of
cervical
cancer
and
its
precursors
.

It
is
now
known
that
specific
types
of
human
papillomaviruses
(
HPV
)
are
the
principal
etiologic
agents
for
both
cervical
cancer
and
its
precursors
.

Additional
cofactors
and
mutational
events
may
be
important
in
the
pathogenesis
of
invasive
cervical
cancers
and
may
include
chromosomal
rearrangements
,
loss
of
constitutional
heterozygosity
,
and
proto
-
oncogene
activation
.

Rats
that
were
irradiated
twice
(
single
fractions
at
0
and
24
hours
after
implantation
)
did
not
show
a
significant
decrease
in
the
neovascularization
of
the
irradiated
implant
compared
with
the
contralateral
control
implant
.

Interestingly
,
neovascularization
of
the
implants
irradiated
with
10
fractions
(
3000
cGy
)
was
not
significantly
decreased
compared
with
irradiation
with
three
fractions
(
900
cGy
)
.

Irradiation
delivered
before
implantation
(
900
cGy
)
inhibited
neovascularization
significantly
less
than
the
same
dose
administered
after
implantation
.

The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
a
subclinical
cumulative
dose
of
900
cGy
is
the
threshold
for
impaired
tissue
revascularization
provided
that
treatment
is
delivered
immediately
after
implantation
over
a
48
-
hour
interval
.

Tumours
from
younger
patients
had
a
higher
grade
of

(
P

)
.

Apart
from
the
vascular
grade
,
none
of
the
other
factors
examined
was
statistically
related
to
lymph
node
metastasis
(
P
less
than

.
0001
)
.

Excluding
N
-
stage
,
vascular
grade
was
the
only
independent
prognostic
factor
(
P
=

.
007
)
.

The
integration
of
vascular
grading
in
clinical
trials
on
adjuvant
chemotherapy
and
/
or
radiotherapy
could
substantially
contribute
in
defining
groups
of
operable
patients
who
might
benefit
from
cytotoxic
treatment
.

Groups

and

were
vitamin

On

mimic
many

of

Our
experiments
demonstrate
that

indeed
induces
hexokinase
gene
expression
in
a
concentration
and

manner
in
two

we
studied
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:
Thirty
-
three
archival
cytologic
specimens
from
eight
patients
with
histologically
confirmed
malignant
mesothelioma
and
13
from
patients
with
metastatic
serous
effusions
were
destained
and
then
immunostained
with
anticalretinin
antiserum
.

Infiltration
of
dendritic
cells
correlated
negatively
with
distant
lymph
node
metastases
,
clinical
stage
,
and
peritoneal
invasion
.

Twenty
-
one
percent
of
clinically
unaffected
family
members
had
elevated
levels
of
bFGF
,
and
13
%
of
patients
with
EBS
had
elevated
levels
of
bFGF
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
have
found
that
patients
with
RDEB
have
elevated
levels
of
bFGF
,
which
may
contribute
to
increased
fibroblast
collagenase
and
the
development
of
squamous
cell
carcinoma
.

At
3
weeks
,
the
endogenous
blood
supply
of
both
the

and
the
experimental

was
isolated
and
ligated
,
and
the
composite
fat
/
muscle
flap
was
transferred
to
the
chest
wall
.

Careful
selection
of
patients
may
be
necessary
before

for

Thus
,

appears
to
participate
in
the
elimination
of

,
such
as
those
arising
in
the

due
to
the

Clustering
algorithms
group
genes
by
similarities
in
expression
patterns
,
based
on
the
assumption
that
co
-
expressed
genes
share
common
function
or
regulation
[
3
,
4
]
;
however
,
clustering
solely
by
co
-
expression
patterns
may
not
reveal
a
considerable
amount
of
information
contained
in
array
data
.

This
process
ultimately
identifies
significant
clusters
of
co
-
expressed
gene
neighbors
that
likely
share
common
function
or
regulation
.

We
compared
data
generated
before
and
after
neighbor
clustering
to
show
that
this
method
provides
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
transcription
by
:
(
1
)
identifying
more
differentially
expressed
genes
than
even
traditional
,
rigorous
statistical
analyses
;
(
2
)
reconstructing
intact
biological
pathways
that
statistical
significance
analysis
could
not
reconstruct
;
and
(
3
)
providing
preliminary
insight
and
clues
about
the
function
or
regulation
of
uncharacterized
genes
by
associating
their
co
-
expression
with
physically
proximate
,
functionally
defined
genes
.

SF370
contains
one
inducible

(

)
and

(

2
,
370
.
3
,
and
370
.
4
)
that
produce
no
infectious
phage
[
39
]
.

We
identified
11
differentially
expressed
phage
370
.
2
genes
,
suggesting
that
this
defective
phage
is
not
transcriptionally
silent
(
Table

)
.

The
speH
gene
encodes
a
mitogenic
exotoxin
[
38
]
reportedly
induced
during
polymorphonuclear
leukocyte
phagocytosis
[
8
]
but
not
implicated
previously
in
adherence
.

The
significant
upregulation
of
the
speH
gene
during
adherence
suggests
that
the
gene
product
may
function
instead
during
a
subsequent
stage
of
infection
.

To
overcome
these
limitations
and
to
extract
more
functional
information
from
the
array
dataset
(
including
more
complete
biological
pathways
)
,
we
developed
the
neighbor
clustering
algorithms
to
combine
the
physical
position
of
genes
on
the
streptococcal
chromosome
with
gene
expression
data
.

Of
the
309
qualifying
clusters
(
Table
S5
)
,
197
(
63
.
8
%
)
were
composed
entirely
of
known
,
functionally
defined
genes
;
however
,
26
(
13
%
)
of
these
were
incorrectly
assembled
,
as
they
contained
known
genes
that
are
functionally
unrelated
.

We
measured
the
performance
of
our
algorithm
by
examining
whether
it
identified
gene
groupings
known
to
be
functionally
related
(
Type
I
clusters
)
.

Only
four
(
16
%
)
of
25
Type
I
clusters
(
spy0080
-
0081
,
spy1236
-
1237
,
spy1707
-
1711
,
spy2041
-
2042
)
could
have
been
identified
in
entirety
by
significance
analysis
because
all
clustered
genes
exhibited
significant
differential
expression
(
PF
value
<
0
.
05
)
.

A
total
of
11
(
52
.
4
%
)
of
the
remaining
21
clusters
would
not
have
been
identified
in
their
entirety
without
GenomeCrawler
because
we
initially
identified
significant
fold
-
changes
in
only
a
subset
of
genes
necessary
to
encode
particular
pathways
or
loci
;
this
is
intuitively
unreasonable
if
all
genes
are
essential
for
functionality
.

GenomeCrawler
expanded
these
clusters
to
contain
more
genes
that
encode
intact
loci
(
Table
3
)
.

We
obtained
a
similar
result
for
the
eight
-
gene
operon
encoding
the
F0F1
-
type
proton
translocating
ATPase
[
41
]
(
spy0754
-
0761
)
.

Each
of
the
11
neighbor
clusters
that
could
have
been
only
partially
identified
by
our
initial
analysis
alone
gained
gene
members
after
application
of
the
algorithms
and
became
more
complete
sets
of
functionally
related
genes
than
initially
identified
(
Table
3
)
.

Recently
,
it
was
reported
that
the
four
genes
spanning
spy0127
-
0130
encode
,
and
are
responsible
for
,
the
formation
of
surface
-
localized
,
trypsin
-
resistant
pili
that
induce
protective
immunity
against
a
lethal
dose
of
group
A
streptococci
in
a
mouse
model
of
infection
[
36
]
.

This
attribute
may
be
particularly
important
for
datasets
in
which
the
relationship
between
clustered
genes
is
not
obvious
,
and
may
facilitate
the
organization
of
larger
datasets
into
more
manageable
packages
.

BlastP
analysis
aligned
the
spy1725
gene
product
,
which
has
homologs
in
all
sequenced
streptococcal
genomes
,
with
the
SP14
.
3
protein
from
S
.
pneumoniae
[
52
]
(
80
%
sequence
similarity
;
67
%
identity
)
.

Although
operon
-
modeling
methods
exist
[
54
,
55
]
,
we
inspected
clusters
in
silico
for
upstream
regulatory
elements
and
identified
17
candidates
,
including
clusters
such
as
streptolysin
S
that
have
been
previously
confirmed
as
operons
[
56
]
;
the
spy0127
-
0130
grouping
,
which
was
confirmed
as
an
operon
in
this
study
;
and
others
that
have
yet
to
be
verified
(
Table
S6
)
.

Concluding
Remarks

Neighbor
clustering
,
despite
the
statistical
framework
with
which
it
assigns
groupings
,
would
be
valuable
to
microarray
data
analysis
only
if
it
produced
biologically
relevant
data
.

Two
distinct
fimbriae
are
found
on
the
surface
of
the
organism
(
Dickinson
et
al
.
,
1988
;
Hamada
et
al
.
,
1996
)
.

The
FimA
protein
is
required
for
P
.
gingivalis
colonization
on
salivary
coated
surfaces
,
and
the
early
colonization
of
dental
plaque
(
Malek
et
al
.
,
1994
;
Levesque
et
al
.
,
2003
;
Maeda
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

Investigation
of
the
mechanism
of
regulation
of
fimA
by
FimR
indicates
that
FimR
does
not
bind
directly
to
the
fimA
promoter
,
but
rather
binds
to
the
promoter
region
of
the
first
gene
(
pg2130
)
in
the
fimA
cluster
,
suggesting
that
PG2130
is
the
FimR
target
gene
,
which
in
turn
regulates
expression
of
other
genes
in
the
fimA
cluster
,
including
the
fimA
gene
(
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

In
this
study
,
it
is
demonstrated
that
FimR
is
a
positive
regulator
of
Mfa1
expression
.

FimA
protein
was
not
detectable
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
while
a
50
%
lower
level
of
Mfa1
protein
was
found
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
compared
with
that
in
wild
-
type
strain
33277
.

Similarly
,
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
RgpA
production
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
which
was
detected
by
anti
-
RgpA
serum
.

The
same
transcriptional
start
site
was
identified
.

This
may
explain
the
much
tighter
control
of
fimA
expression
by
FimR
.

Data
of
this
study
suggest
that
transcription
of
the
mfa1
gene
originated
at
a
distal
upstream
transcriptional
start
site
and
read

the

by
Park

.

The
genetic
lesions
of
BCG
have
recently
been
determined
[
2
-
4
]
,
revealing
that
the
loss
of
region
of
difference
1
(
RD1
)
,
which
encodes
part
of
the
ESX
-
1
secretion
system
[
5
]
,
was
one
of
the
key
events
in
its
attenuation
.

To
evaluate
the
phenotypic
effect
of
the
different
SNPs
and
to
assess
their
potential
contribution
to
the
attenuation
process
,
we
undertook
functional
genomic
analyses
using
knock
-
ins
of
H37Ra
,
as
described
previously
[
18
]
.

However
,
as
already
observed
in
macrophages
,
integration
of
phoP
did
not
restore
levels
of
virulence
to
those
of
the
reference
strain
H37Rv
(
Figure

)
.

Groups
of
C57BL
/
6
mice
were
subcutaneously
inoculated
with
H37Rv
,
H37Ra
,
or
one
of
three
recombinant
H37Ra
strains
complemented
with
phoP
,
fadE5
,
or
rpsL
,
respectively
.

Most
importantly
,
the
various
strains
differed
extensively
in
their
potential
to
induce
antigen
specific
T
cell
responses
towards
ESAT
-
6
and
CFP
-
10
.

To
further
evaluate
the
involvement
of
phoP
and
the
ESX
-
1
system
in
immunogenicity
,
C57BL
/
6
mice
were
vaccinated
with
additional
strains
.

However
,
hardly
any
ESAT

was
present
in
the
culture
filtrates
of
these
cultures
,
indicating
that
these
strains
were
unable
to
secrete
ESAT
-

under
the
in

conditions
employed
in
spite
of
proper
expression
.

Analysis
of
the

showed
strong
expression
of
ESAT

,
but
only
very
little
secreted
ESAT

(
Figure

)
.

Discussion

Finally
,
microarray
-
based
trancriptome
analysis
using
the
wild
-
type
versus
a
phoP
ko
mutant
of
H37Rv
has
provided
an
overview
of
the
transcriptional
regulation
linked
to
PhoP
[
21
]
.

It
is
not
clear
yet
which
factors
might
contribute
to
this
effect
.

In
contrast
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
is
widely
found
in
the
environment
and
mainly
known
to
cause
gastroenteritis
in
men
,
but
has
only
recently
been
shown
to
be
also
toxic
for
insects
.

We
therefore
decided
to
perform
a
comparative
study
of
the
genomes
of
Photorhabdus
luminescens
and
Yersinia
enterocolitica
.

However
,
Y
.
pestis
,
a
blood
-
borne
pathogen
and
the
etiological
agent
of
human
plague
,
has
long
been
known
to
be
transmitted
by
insects
,
specifically
by
rat
fleas
.

Upon
entering
an
insect
host
,
the
nematodes
release
the
bacteria
by
regurgiation
directly
into
the
insect
hemocoel
,
the
open
circulatory
system
of
the
insect
.

Once
inside
the
hemocoel
,
the
bacteria
replicate
rapidly
and
establish
a
lethal
septemica
in
the
host
by
the
production
of
virulence
factors
such
as
the
insecticidal
toxin
complexes
that
kill
the
insect
within
48
hours
.

Sensing
,
signalling
,
and
regulation
Bacteria
have
evolved
several
regulation
mechanisms
to
ensure
a
proper
answer
to
changing
environments
.

The
principal
biological
reason
for
this
redundancy
remains
unclear
.

,
and
include
PhoP
/
PhoQ
,
and
AstS
/
AstR
(
BvgS
/
BvgR
)
which
have
been
identified
to
be
involved
in
virulence
[
28
]
.

The
AstS
/
AstR
TCS
is
required
for
the
correct
timing
of
phase
variant
switching
in
P
.
luminescens
[
28
]
.

BvgS
/
BvgR
is
the
TCS
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
that
corresponds
to
AstS
/
AstR
.

In
the
genome
of
P
.
luminescens
,
two
genes
encoding
putative
AHL
-
LuxR
-
like
receptors
,
plu0320
and
plu4562
,
but
no
luxI
genes
are
present
(
Fig
.
3
)
.

Instead
of
producing
AHLs
to
regulate
quorum
dependent
genes
,
a
common
strategy
of
insect
-
colonizing
bacteria
might
be
the
detection
of
AHLs
as
a
signal
for
the
presence
of
other
bacteria
such
as
those
colonizing
the
insect
intestinal
tract
or
living
in
soil
.

It
has
been
shown
that
the
luxS
pathway
negatively
controls
the
expression
of
genes
for
carbapenem
antibiotic
biosynthesis
in
P
.
luminescens
[
41
]
.

Homologues
of
these
proteins
are
present
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
(
see
chapter
2
)
,
suggesting
their
possible
regulation
by
AI
-
2
also
in
this
bacterium
.

Whether
they
sense
self
-
produced
or
external
AI
-
2
,
or
a
combination
of
both
,
indicating
a
quorum
sensing
mechanism
or
a
regulation
similar
to
AHL
as
described
above
,
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Met
has
been
shown
to
bind
JH
at
physiological
concentrations
and
is
therefore
suspected
to
act
as
a
JH
receptor
[
46
,
47
]
.

In
P
.
luminescens
,
expression
of
UspA
has
been
shown
to
be
under
control
of
the
AstS
/
AstR
TCS
,
which
is
important
for
the
correct
timing
of
phase
variant
switching
[
28
]
.

A
GroEL
homologue
is
present
in
P
.
luminescens
(
Plu4134
)
which
the
P
.
luminescens
UspG
homologues
might
interact
with
.

This
pattern
corresponds
to
the
overlapping
life
cycles
of
both
pathogens
(
Fig
.
1
)
.

Furthermore
,
two
proteins
with
PilZ
domain
exist
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
namely
YE3197
and
BcsA
(
YE4074
)
,
a
putative
cellulose
synthase
.

Cellulose
synthesis
in
bacteria
has
been
identified
to
be
important
for
the
protection
from
chemical
or
mechanical
stress
by
forming
a
hydrophobic
extracellular
matrix
[
60
]
.

All
virulence
factors
described
in
the
following
are
summarized
in
Fig
.

It
is
speculated
that
the
Tc
toxins
are
active
against
different
tissues
within
individual
hosts
,
namely
Tcb
against
hemocytes
and
Tcd
and
Tca
against
cells
of
the
insect
gut
.

Hemolysins
or
surface
-
associated
adhesins
,
together
with
their
transporters
,
are
sometimes
organized
as
two
-
partner
secretion
(
TPS
)
systems
,
a
specialized
mechanism
for
the
delivery
of
large
exoproteins
[
65
]
.

Eight
other
TPS
systems
are
present
in
P
.
luminescens
,
namely
Plu0225
/
Plu0226
,
Plu0548
/
Plu0549
,
Plu1149
/
Plu1150
,
Plu1367

Plu1368

Plu3125

3127
/
3128
,
Plu3667
/
Plu3668
,
and
Plu3718
/
Plu3719
,
and
further
three
genes
for
which
the
partner
locus
has
not
been
identified
(
Fig
.

)
.

Examples
are
SopB
,
a
host
cell
invasion
factor
translocated
via
the
type
-
III
secretion
system
that
is
present
in
the
emerging
human
pathogen
P
.
asymbiotica
,
but
not
in
the
insect
pathogen
P
.
luminescens
[
14
]
,
a
putative
effector
protein
(
YE2447
)
with
proteolytic
activity
,
and
a
homologue
of
SrfA
which
is
negatively
regulated
by
PhoP
in
S
.
typhimurium
[
75
]
.

Examples
of
those
factors
are
shown
in
Fig
.

In
P
.
luminescens
,
eleven
fimbrial
gene
cluster
have
been
identified
,
four
of
which
(
V
,
VII
,
IX
and
X
)
are
also
present
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Remarkable
exceptions
are
the
toxin
/
antitoxin
system
ccdA
/
ccdB
,
the
tolQRAB
/
pal
operon
involved
in
group
A
colicin
translocation
,
and
a
colicin
production
and
secretion
system
(
Plu3168
/
Plu3869
;
YE0791
/
YE1314
)
.

These
are
substrate
-
specific
secretion
machineries
that
share
a
similar
architecture
and
secretion
mechanism
[
88
]
.

VAS
-
dependent
secretion
has
been
found
to
be
important
for
virulence
of
Vibrio
cholerae
[
92
]
as
well
as
for
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
[
93
]
,
and
T6SS
are
assumed
to
play
a
major
role
in
virulence
in
many
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
[
91
]
.

Due
to
its
absence
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
Ymt
is
another
example
for
the
high
diversity
of
genetic
determinants
that
are
used
by
closely
related
bacterial
pathogens
to
interact
with
their
insect
hosts
.

There
are
several
other
exoenzymes
present
either
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
or
in
P
.
luminescens
,
which
do
not
have
a
homologue
counterpart
in
the
other
bacterium
.

Metabolism

Degradative
pathways
P
.
luminescens
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
share
loci
encoding
several
common
degradation
pathways
that
are
absent
in
E
.
coli
K
-

,
including
the
urease
operon
(
ureABCEFGD
)
,
the
genes
involved
in
myo
-
inositol
degradation
,
and
the
histidine
degradation
operon
(
hutHUCGI
)
.

We
recently
reported
that
the
genes
of
the
urease
operon
as
well
as
a
histidine
ammonia
lyase
(
ye3021
/
plu1240
)
,
which
deaminates
histidine
to
urocanic
acid
,
are
highly
induced
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
upon
temperature
decrease
[
67
]
.

Beside
arginine
(

mumol

)
,
lysine
(

23
mumol
/

)
,
serine
(

.
77
mumol

)
and
proline
(
6
.
40
mumol

)
,
histidine
(

04
mumol
/
g
)
is
the
most
abundant
free
amino
acids
in
the
Hyalophora
gloveri
fat
body
[
98
]
.

Beside
S
.
typhimurium
,
all
these
genetic
determinants
were
found
only
in
few
other
bacteria
,
namely
the
human
pathogens
Listeria
monocytogenes
,
and
Clostridium
perfringens
[
101
]
.

Further
metabolic
genes
common
to
both
pathogens
are
dctA
responsible
for
transport
of
C4
-
dicarboxylates
across
the
membrane
,
the
UhpABC
regulatory
system
controlling
the
hexose
phosphate
transport
by
UhpT
,
and
the
three
Mg2
+
transport
systems
CorA
,
MgtA
and
MgtB
.

Another
gene
,
gltP
encoding
a
glutamate
-
aspartate
symporter
,
is
also
up
-
regulated
at
low
temperature
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
but
lacks
a
counterpart
in
P
.
luminescens
.

Genes
involved
in
the
biosynthesis
,
transport
and
regulation
of
the
siderophore
yersiniabactin
are
clustered
in
the
high
pathogenicity
island
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
[
103
]
and
have
counterparts
in
P
.
luminescens
(
plu2316
-
2324
)
.

While
Y
.
enterocolitica
explores
citrate
for
anaerobic
metabolism
,
it
is
most
likely
that
the
specific
uptake
of
citrate
and
other
tricarboxylic
acids
by
TctCBA
is
used
by
P
.
luminescens
upon
entering
the
insect
host
where
enough
citrate
is
available
.

In
Yersinia
,
temperature
-
dependent
gene
expression
has
been
described
to
be
an
important
theme
in
bacterial
mechanisms
of
pathogenesis
towards
humans
[
116
]
.

By
data
mining
,
we
identified
32
genes
or
gene
loci
of
Yersinia
spp
.
that
exhibit
stronger
expression
with
temperature
decrease
(
Table
1
)
.

19
of
them
have
a
homologue
in
P
.
luminescens
.

The
data
have
derived
from
expression
profiling
in
vitro
and
cannot
directly
be
translated
to
the
in
vivo
situation
.

It
is
assumed
that
the
PZ
has
not
been
acquired
by
a
single
event
of
gene
transfer
,
but
through
a
series
of
independent
insertions
[
23
]
.

Those
adaptational
processes
must
be
precisely
regulated
by
the
bacteria
.

Staphylococcus
aureus
,
a
frequent
cause
of
human
infections
,
is
highly
resistant
to
antimicrobial
factors
of
the
innate
immune
system
such
as
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
(
CAMPs
)
[
1
,
2
]
which
are
produced
by
epithelial
cells
and
neutrophils
[
3
,
4
]
.

Due
to
their
cationic
properties
,
CAMPs
can
easily
bind
to
the
highly
negatively
charged
bacterial
cell
envelope
and
inactivate
bacteria
,
e
.
g
.
by
forming
pores
in
the
bacterial
membrane
leading
to
bacterial
lysis
[
6
]
.

To
control
for
this
possibility
,
we
compared
patterns
of
membrane
lipids
from
log
-
phase
bacteria
by
thin
-
layer
chromatography
.

Significantly
less
bacteria
were
detected
in
the
kidneys
of
animals
,
which
had
been
infected
with
the
graRS
mutant
than
those
infected
with
the
WT
bacteria
.

However
,
which
of
factors
are
involved
in
pathogenesis
mediated
by
clinically
isolated
severe
invasive
GAS
remains
obscure
.

Epidemiological
and
pathological
findings
,
including
sporadic
incidents
of
severe
invasive
GAS
infections
[
9
]
,
high
frequency
of
severe
invasive
infections
in
immunocompromised
host
[
9
]
,
and
aggregation
of
bacteria
and
a
paucity
of
polymorphnuclear
neutrophils
(
PMN
)
in
foci
of
invasive
GAS
infection
[
10
]
suggest
that
host
defense
factors
play
an
important
role
in
the
onset
of
invasive
infections
.

These
data
may
participate
in
prediction
of
GAS
potential
for
future
invasive
infection
as
well
as
risk
assessment
of
patients
by
measuring
PMN
function
.

The
similar
results
were
obtained
when
opsonized
with
either
FCS
or
human
serum
regardless
of
complements
immobilization
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Flow
cytometry
analysis
suggested
that
although
PMN
was
detected
in
the
lower
well
consisted
of
IL
-
8
and
severe
invasive
GAS
,
but
most
of
them
were
dead
as
defined
by
propidium
iodine
staining
(
p

016
)
(
Figure
2A
and
2C
)
demonstrating
that
severe
invasive
GAS
affected
survival
of
PMN
and
its
migration
activity
in
a
transwell
system
.

PMN
were
killed
by
streptolysin
O
(
SLO
)
from
severe
invasive
GAS

Subcutaneous
inoculation
of
NIH230scpC
and
NIH230slo
yielded
the
local
infected
lesions
with
area
comparable
to
those
of
1566
and
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
during
the
course
of
infection
(
Figure
7D
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
enhanced
expression
of
ScpC
and
SLO
in
invasive
GAS
plays
an
important
role
in
vivo
virulence
of
GAS
infection
.

DNase
activity
of
the
emm49
severe
invasive
GAS
was
lower
than
that
of
non
-
invasive
GAS
(
Figure
S1B
)
,
possibly
due
to
the
difference
of
emm
type
.

SLO
is
a
cholesterol
-
binding
pore
-
forming
hemolysin
as
well
as
cytotoxic
for
other
cells
[

]
.

A
further
study
in
which
collates
clinical
with
bacterial
/
immunological
data
may
provide
with
novel
clues
for
early
diagnosis
and
therapeutics
of
invasive
bacterial
infections
.

DNA

mediated
killing
occurred
within
minutes

as
a

of

of

contents
,
including

.

A
number
of

that
influence

have
been
described
.

The

of

accounts
for
their

presumably
as
a
consequence
of
the

of

,
cell

and
release
of
cytoplasmic

,
including
DNA
(

)
.

Protection
was
measured
in
response
to
a
range
of
cation
concentrations
,
where
the
highest
concentration
tested
was
that
which
remained
soluble
in
the
presence
of

(

.

Cations
play
diverse
physiologically
important
roles
within
a

;
from
detoxification
of

species
and
co

factors
for
enzymes
to
the
stabilization
of
macromolecules
within
the

[

.

To
determine
if
extracellular
DNA
imposes
Mg2
+
limitation
,
we
measured
the
gene
expression
of
a
chromosomally
encoded
transcriptional
lux
(
bioluminescence
)
fusion
to
PA3553
,
as
a
measure
of
the
CAP

operon
expression
in
planktonic
cultures
.

P
.
aeruginosa
genomic
DNA
inhibited
growth
at
similar
concentrations
as
salmon
sperm
DNA
.

This
is
due
to
the
addition
of
excess
Mg2
+
ions
as
part
of
the
DNAse
buffer
,
which
is
required
for
DNAse
activity
.

To
determine
if
DNA
-
induced
resistance
requires
these
genes
in
biofilms
,
the
resistance
phenotype
of
the
PA3553

lux
mutant
was
determined
.

Recently
,
a
novel
host
defense
mechanism
was
discovered
whereby
stimulated
neutrophils
ejected
a
mesh
-
like
net
of
intracellular
DNA
and
proteins
that
functions
to
trap
and
kill
pathogens
[

]
.

The
antimicrobial
property
of
neutrophil
nets
was
attributed
to
DNA
-
associated
histones
and
other
antimicrobial
peptides
[

]
.

It
has
previously
been
reported
that
Mg2

concentrations
within
the
airway
surface

are
high
(

)
[

,

.

However
,
induction
of
PA3553
gene
expression
does
not
occur
in
the
presence
of

(

.

This
study
aims
at
evaluating
the
importance
of
the
two

system
VicRK
to
virulence
of
the

and
the
potential
of
a

as
a

candidate
using
mouse

models
.

Intranasal
DeltavicK

induces

This
study
aims
at
evaluating
the

virulence
and
the
potential
of
a
vicK

as

.

Three
putative
DeltavicK
strains
,
which
were
spectinomycin

resistant
and
chloramphenicol
-
sensitive
,
were
obtained
.

The
samples
were
incubated
for
4
h
,
and
the
numbers
of
the
bacteria
in
the
samples
and
inocula
at
time
zero
were
determined
by
plating
.

The

pyogenes
,
which
is
no
longer
resistant
to
phagocytosis
by
PMNs
,
was
used
as
a
positive
control
in
the
assay
.

The
percentages
of
PMNs
with
associated
wild
-
type
S
.
equi
and
spy1718
:
:
aad
were
low
and
high
,
respectively
,
indicating
that
the
assay
worked
well
to
evaluate
resistance
of
the
bacteria
to
phagocytosis
.

Seven
of
the
8
mice
infected
with
the
wild

type
S

equi
strain
died
,
whereas
7
of
the
8
mice
inoculated
with
DeltavicK
survived
(
Fig
.

)
.

Similarly
,
these
4
mice
with
higher
IgA
levels
also
had
higher
levels
of
SeM
-
specific
systemic
IgG
(

)
.

Thus
,
VicK
is
not
essential
in
S

.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
interplay
between
a
pathogen
and
its
host
from
a
systems
biology
standpoint
,
we
focused
on
these
14
genes
.

These
regions
include
two
40
kb
stretches
of
DNA
termed
Salmonella
pathogenicity
islands

(

)
and

(

.

Salmonella
regulators
required
for
systemic
mouse
infection
Typhimurium
encodes
a
surfeit
of
regulators
(
more
than
330
based
on
annotation
cited
in
NCBI
)
presumably
because
it
can
survive
and
replicate
in
many
different
environments
,
cause
infection
in
diverse
hosts
,
and
can
use
multiple
carbon
sources
and
terminal
electron
acceptors
.

BALB
/
c
mice
infection
to
eliminate
other
regulators
required
only
for
gastrointestinal
infection
or
persistence
but
most
of
these
strains
were
avirulent
in
another
strain
of
mice
(
129X1
/
SvJ
)
and
by
other
route
(
intragastric
)
of
infection
(
see
Table
S1
)
.

Even
at
the
shortest
time
few
intracellular
bacteria
were
recovered
from
macrophage
infection
with
an
rpoE
mutant
,
suggesting
that
this
strain
is
very
sensitive
to
microbicidal
factors
released
by
macrophages
on
contact
with
bacteria
or
doesn
'
t
get
internalized
very
well
.

Because
some
of
the
Typhimurium
regulator
mutants
survived
so
poorly
within
macrophages
that
preparing
mRNA
from
intracellular
bacteria
was
not
possible
we
have
used
in
vitro
growth
conditions
that
duplicate
some
of
the
intracellular
conditions
(
low
pH
,
minimal
media
;
[
47
]
,
[
48
]
)
.

We
observed
that
the
results
determined
by
these
two
methods
matched
closely
(
Figure
S2
)
and
that
the
level
of
transcription
of
ssaG
was
highest
when
Salmonella
was
grown
in
minimal
acidic
media
.

The
three
exceptions
were
spvR
,
fruR
,
and
rpoS
.

We
searched
for
additional
previously
unidentified
virulence
factors
encoded
elsewhere
on
the
chromosome
that
show
the
same
pattern
of
expression
as
those
located
within
SPI
-
2
.

To
detect
dependencies
among
genes
over
different
conditions
we
employed
the
context
likelihood
of
relatedness
algorithm
(
CLR
;
[
19
]
)
,
which
is
a
plugin
for
SEBINI
.

In
the
computed
network
multiple
regulators
act
both
directly
and
indirectly
to
control
SPI
-
2
expression
.

So
,
in
Figure
6B
all
regulatory
effects
on
SPI
-
2
have
been
removed
except
for
those
mediated
directly
by
slyA
and
ssrB
based
on
additional
genetic
data
as
described
below
.

The
consensus
network
combining
all
data
reported
in
this
study
includes
the
network
computed
from
qRT
-
PCR
(
Figure
6B
)
in
part
and
suggests
a
predictive
regulatory
cascade
that
merits
a
test
.

The
complementation
result
suggests
that
many
of
the
regulators
may
function
on
SPI
-
2
through
SlyA
activation
of
ssrB
or
alternatively
via
both
regulators
(
slyA
and
ssrB
)
acting
together
.

To
test
this
possibility
we
constructed
double
deletions
of
ssrAB
/
ompRenvZ
,
ssrAB
/
phoPQ
,
ssrAB
/
csrA
and
ssrAB
/
himD
.

Furthermore
there
was
a
clear
dichotomy
in
expression
between
the
first
two
SPI
-
2
operons
encoding
ssaB
-
ssaE
and
sseA
-
sseG
and
the
operons
further
downstream
(
ssaG
-
ssaQ
)
suggesting
that
slyA
may
act
at
different
sites
within
SPI
-

.

During
systemic
mouse
infection
,
Salmonella
processes
multiple
environmental
cues
via
more
than
14
regulators
We
performed
virulence
assays
on
83
regulators
previously
identified
as
required
for
Salmonella
enteriditis
virulence
by
one
or
more
negative
selection
experiments
in
various
hosts
including
calves
,
chickens
,
and
mice
[
13
]
,
[
21
]
-
[
23
]
.

This
operon
encodes
some
of
the
most
abundantly
expressed
proteins
by
intracellular
Salmonella
.

In
our
transcriptional
network
each
pink
node
represents
a
regulator
(
Figure
6
B
)
and
lines
represent
positive
or
negative
transcriptional
interactions
(
positive
in
red
and
negative
in
blue
)
.

For
SPI
-
2
ssrB
plays
this
role
and
for
SPI
-
1
hilA
is
the
central
regulator
.

It
is
possible
that
SsrB
can
be
phosphorylated
from
other
sources
as
noted
by
Walthers
et
al
.

Mutations
in
rpoE
,
smpB
,
rpoS
,
and
hfq
showed
only
small
decreases
in
SPI
-
2
gene
transcription
during
growth
in
minimal
acidic
media
but
some
of
them
showed
large
defects
in
survival
assays
performed
in
murine
macrophages
.

For
rpoE
and
rpoS
it
is
possible
that
the
environmental
conditions
that
distinguish
growth
in
minimal
media
from
those
in
the
SCV
inside
hosts
are
sensed
via
these
two
alternative
sigma
factors
.

Four
nucleoid
-
like
proteins
in
enteric
bacteria
,
H
-
NS
,
StpA
,
Hha
,
and
YdgT
have
a
predilection
for
binding
to
A
+
T
rich
sequences
and
repress
transcription
of
SPI
-
2
genes
(
rev
.
in
[
14
]
)
.

This
model
is
supported
by
SlyA
binding
sites
that
are
located
downstream
of
transcriptional
start
sites
[
31
]
,
[
86
]
,
which
is
unusual
for
a
traditional
transcriptional
activator
.

In
agreement
with
this
model
,
SlyA
and
PhoP
counteract
H
-
NS
silencing
at
pagC
[
85
]
,
[
87
]
.

Complete
elucidation
of
the
virulence
pathways
must
include
proteomic
studies
to
identify
steps
that
require
translational
regulation
,
binding
studies
to
distinguish
direct
from
indirect
effects
and
additional
regulators
not
included
in
this
preliminary
group
of
14
.

The
construction
of
a
complete
interaction
network
describing
both
the
host
and
pathogen
is
a
long
-
term
goal
of
this
and
other
related
research
efforts
.

Biochemical
analysis
of
purified
Rv2623
suggested
that
this
mycobacterial
USP
binds
ATP
,
and
the
2
.

A
-
resolution
crystal
structure
revealed
that
Rv2623
engages
ATP
in
a
novel
nucleotide
-
binding
pocket
.

Recrudescence
of
latent
bacilli
contributes
significantly
to
the
incidence
of
adult
tuberculosis
[
2
]
,
yet
the
physiological
state
of
latent
bacilli
and
the
signals
that
promote
dormancy
in
the
host
remain
incompletely
defined
.

The
rv2623
-
specific
allelic
exchange
construct
was
delivered
via
recombinant
mycobacteriophage
phAE159
and
transformants
were
analyzed
by
Southern
blot
,
confirming
replacement
of
rv2623
with
the
hyg
gene
,
which
confers
hygromycin
resistance
(
Figure
1A
)
.

These
results
support
the
notion
that
it
is
unlikely
that
M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
is
essential
for
resistance
to
stresses
encountered
in
the
host
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
observed
in
vivo
hypervirulence
phenotype
of
Deltarv2623
.

On
the
basis
of
structures
of

,
a
G

was
suggested
to
be
essential
for
the

of

[

.

Each

composed
of

Mechanistically
,
results
of
the
mutagenesis
studies
have
shown
that
Rv2623
regulates
growth
through
ATP
-
dependent
function
.

Moreover
,
discontinuation
of
bfiS
,
bfmR
,
and
mifR
expression
in
established
biofilms
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
biofilms
to
an
earlier
developmental
stage
,
indicating
a
requirement
for
these
regulatory
systems
for
the
development
and
maintenance
of
normal
biofilm
architecture
.

Introduction

Biofilms
form
when
bacteria
adhere
to
surfaces
in
moist
environments
.

Vallet
et
al
.

This
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
transition
to
later
stages
of
biofilm
formation
,
which
coincide
with
distinct
phenotypes
compared
to
planktonic
and
initial
attached
bacterial
cells
,
also
involves
sensing
of
environmental
signal
(
s
)
and
requires
the
coordinated
transduction
of
phosphorylation
events
(
phosphorelays
)
.

Furthermore
,
we
report
the
identification
of
three
novel
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
named
BfiRS
(
PA4196
-
4197
)
,
BfmRS
(
PA4101
-
4102
)
,
and
MifRS
(
PA5511
-
5512
)
that
coordinate
phosphorylation
events
required
for
the
progression
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
in
a
stage
-
specific
manner
.

The
increase
in
similarity
between
the
planktonic
and
the
216
-
hr
-
old
biofilm
phosphoproteomes
is
consistent
with
previous
reports
indicating
that
cells
within
dispersion
-
stage
biofilms
are
returning
to
the
planktonic
mode
of
growth
[
12
]
,
[
50
]
.

We
therefore
also
purified
phosphorylated
proteins
using
metal
oxide
affinity
chromatography
(
MOAC
,
see
Fig
.
S1
)
,
a
gel
-
independent
approach
allowing
for
the
enrichment
of
phosphoproteins
independent
of
the
phosphorylation
site
with
an
up
to
100
%
specificity
[
51
]
,
[
52
]
,
followed
by
cleavable
isotope
coded
affinity
tag
(
cICAT
)
labeling
and
analysis
by
liquid
chromatography
tandem
mass
spectrometry
(
LC
-
MS
/
MS
)
.

Similarly
to
the
results
obtained
via
immunoblot
analysis
,
the
changes
in
phosphorylation
events
over
the
course
of
biofilm
development
detected
using
LC
-
MS
-
MS
analysis
appeared
to
be
stage
-
specific
(
two
examples
are
shown
in
Suppl
.
Fig
.

)
,
with
the
similarity
to
the
planktonic
patterns
decreasing
from
72
%
in
8
hr
biofilms
to
38
%
in
144
hr
biofilms
(
Fig
.
1C
)
.

This
is
the
first
description
of
the
dynamic
changes
of
the
phosphoproteome
occurring
during
biofilm
development
.

Based
on
the
role
of
PA4197
in
the
initiation
of
biofilm
formation
,
we
named
the
PA4197
ORF
Biofilm
initiation
Sensor
(
BfiS
)
.

BfiS
is
an
unusual
sensor
that
harbors
a
His
kinase
A
domain
typically
found
in
two
-
component
system
(
TCS
)
sensor
proteins
,
a
Histidine
kinase
-
like
ATPase
domain
involved
in
autophosphorylation
but
also
in
protein
dephosphorylation
events
,
and
a
PAS
signal
receiver
domain
[

.

Mutant
biofilms
display
protein
and
phosphorylation
patterns
indicative
of
stage
-
specific
arrest
of
biofilm
development

,
cluster
analysis
based
on
protein
similarity
confirmed
our
previous
findings
obtained
by
microscopic
and
phosphoproteome
analyses
of
mutant
biofilms
.

NtrC
-
like
regulators
belong
to
a
family
of
transcriptional
activators
which
control
a
variety
of
physiological
processes
in
response
to
environmental

[

.

This
family
of
regulators
control

from

recognized
by
RNA

that
utilizes
the
alternative

encoded
by

and
its

.

While

by
a

factors
in

requires
the
consecutive
activity
of
multiple
sigma

including
Sigma

,
G
,
and
K
.

BfiR
harbors

(
RpoD
)
-
like
sigma

,
a
domain
involved
in

to

elements
.

In
summary
,
we
have
evidence
of
three
novel
regulatory
systems
playing
a
role
in
the
progression
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
in
a
stage
-
specific
manner
.

Furthermore
,
the
finding
of
sequential
and
essential
regulatory
steps
in
biofilm
formation
and
the
involvement
of
at
least
two
sigma
factors
suggests
that
biofilm
development
is
analogous
to
other
programmed
developmental
processes
.

Many
Gram

negative
bacteria
that
colonize
host
animals
use
a
type

secretion
system
(
T3SS
)
to
deliver
effector
proteins
directly
into
host
cells
where
their
interaction
with
host
proteins
and
membranes
contribute
to
pathogenesis
.

Current
literature
groups
secretion
chaperones
into
three
classes
based
on
their
physical
interactions

[

[

.

However
no
structures
are
available
for

T3SS
chaperones
whose
effector
repertoire
seems
considerably
larger
than
that
of

system
.

We
solved
the
crystal
structure
of
SrcA
and
performed
additional
biochemical
,
proteomic
and
in

experiments
that
revealed
SrcA
to
be
a
class
I
chaperone
required
for
bacterial
fitness
in
the
host
environment
.

Each
monomer
consisted
of
a
small

As
expected
from
data
with
the
complemented

,
expression
of
srcA
in
trans
restored
effector
secretion
in
the

mutant
(
data

.

The
interaction
between
SrcA
and
SsaN
supports
an
emerging
paradigm
whereby
secretion
chaperones
bring
effector
cargo
to
the
T3SS
through
physical
interaction
with
the
hexameric
ATPase
at
the
base
of

Due
to
low

content
compared
to
the

average
of
52

it
'
s
likely
that

(

%
G
+
C
)
and
an
adjacent
gene
,
STM2137
(
37
%

C
)
,
were
acquired
as
a
foreign
islet
that
was
retained
in
organisms
containing
the
SPI

2
T3SS
due
to
the
selective
advantage
afforded
by
the
new
protein
interactions
so
created
.

Our
results
suggest
that
transit
through

induces
a

that
enhances
survival
and

of
Y

after

to
the

.

Y

circulates
among

to
those
of

planktonic

typical
of
the

implicated
several

and
in

.

During
the

,
Y

pestis
grows

The
central
role
of
the
L
-
glutamate
family
of
amino
acids
may
also
confer
this
advantage
in
the
flea
gut
,
because
Glu
and
Pro
are
osmoprotectants
.

Insect
midgut
epithelium
is
typified
by
multiple
amino

with
specific
substrates
and

kinetics
,
but
different
amino
acids
enter
the
hemocoel
at
different
rates
and
amounts
[

]
,
[
15
]
.

Although
the
flea
gut
contains
lipid
derived
from
the
blood
meal
,
Y
.
pestis
does
not
appear
to
use
it
as
a
major
energy
source
.

Amino
acid
carbon
is
presumably
funneled
into
the
TCA
cycle
,
the
genes
for
which
are
highly
expressed
in
the
flea
(
Table
S3
)
.

The
transcriptional

of

pestis
in

showed

in

.

Although
genes
in
the
polyamine
transport
gabTpotDBC
locus
are
among
the
most
highly
induced
genes
in
the
flea
(
Table
S1
)
and
polyamines
are
essential
for
Y
.
pestis
biofilm
formation
[
30
]
,
we
have
previously
reported
that
a
Y
.
pestis
Deltapot
mutant
has
no
defect
in
flea
infection
or
blockage
[
31
]
.

With
this
study
,
the
in

transcriptome
of
Y
.
pestis
in
blocked
fleas
and
in
the
rat
bubo
[
11
]
have
now
both
been
characterized
.

Other
virulence
and
transmission
factors
were
not
differentially
regulated
,
including
the
hms
genes
;
and
the
Y

pestis
plasminogen
activator
(
pla

,
critical
for
dissemination
from
extravascular
tissue
at
the
fleabite
site
[
33
]
,
and
ymt
were
highly
expressed
in
both
hosts
(
Table
S3
and
[

)
.

The

,
recently
shown
to
be
required
for
dissemination
and
bubonic
plague
pathogenesis
from
a
subcutaneous

site
[

]
,
was
significantly
upregulated
in
both
the
flea
and
the
bubo
compared
to
in
vitro
conditions
(
Tables

,
S1
)
.

Bacteria
from
fleas
showed
significantly
lower
levels
of
phagocytosis
(
Fig
.

)
.

Because
phoP
is
required
by
Y
.
pestis
to
produce
a
transmissible
infection
in
fleas
(
unpublished
data
)
,
it
was
not
possible
to
similarly
assess
the
effect
on
disease
transmission
of
phoP
induction
in
the
flea
.

Does
transit
through
the
flea
vector
preadapt
Y
.
pestis
to
resist
mammalian
innate
immunity
?

In
summary
,
Y
.
pestis
appears
to
be
prepared
for
pathogenesis
in
the
mammal
while
still
in
the
flea

Transcriptome
Analysis
of
the
Brucella

BvrR

Two

Component
Regulatory
System

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
were
affected
,
including
VjbR
,
ExoR
and
OmpR
that
were
less
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

These
regulatory
systems
are
highly
conserved
among
bacteria
and
widely
used
for
controlling
gene
expression
in
response
to
environmental
signals
.

B

abortus

in
this
system
were
more
susceptible
to
bactericidal
polycationic
substances
like
polymyxin
B
,
melittin
or

,
and
displayed
a
more
hydrophobic
outer
membrane
surface
than
the
parental
strain
[

.

B

abortus
RNA
was
obtained
from
three
independent
cultures
of
each
wild
type
and
bvrR

cells
grown
in
the

.

Data
were
normalized
by

method
[

using
the
IF

housekeeping
gene
of
Brucella
as
reference
(

.

Interestingly
,
the
level
of
transcription
obtained
by
RT

of
the
flagellar
genes
fliM
(
BAB2

and
motB
(
BAB2

)
,
and
the
pckA
gene
(
BAB1
_
2091
)
were
the
highest
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

On
the
other
hand
,
exoR
(
BAB1

,
omp25a
(
BAB1

,

(
BAB1

,
BAB1

)
were
among
the
less
expressed
genes
(
Table

)
.

Other
authors
[

]
suggest
that
ExoR
is
an
inhibitor
of
two

component
signaling
that
may
be
conserved
in
a
large
number
of
alpha

.

In
order
to
investigate
if
the
BvrR

genes
were
expressed
intracellularly
,
bacterial

was
obtained
from

Due
to
the
unavailability
of

,
it
is
not
known
whether
SeMac
cleaves
the

SeMac

,
confirming
the
previous

.

S

a

.

The
fact
that
SeMac
does
not
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S

equi
by

indicates
that
SeMac
is
not

in
the

The
acid
tolerance
response
of
Salmonella
results
in
the
synthesis
of
over
50
acid
shock
proteins
(
Bearson
et
al
.
,
1998
)
that
are
likely
to
function
primarily
when
variations
in
internal
pH
occur
,
i

e
.
when
Salmonella
experiences
severe
acidic
conditions
(
pH

)
(
Foster

.

The
low
Mg2
+
activation
of
the
PmrA
protein
requires
PhoQ
,
a
protein
that
senses
extracellular
Mg2
+
levels
(
Vescovi
et
al
.
,
1996
)
,
PhoQ
'
s
cognate
regulator
PhoP
,
and
the
PhoP
-
activated
protein
PmrD
(
Kox
et
al
.
,
2000
;
Kato
and
Groisman
,
2004
)
.

Here
we
show
that
PmrA
'
s
cognate
sensor
kinase
PmrB
is
required
for
responding
to
external
changes
in
pH
through
a
mechanism
that
requires
a
histidine
and
several
glutamic
acid
residues
located
in
its
periplasmic
domain
,
as
well
as
the
post
-
translational
activator
PmrD
protein
.

Results

We
considered
the
possibility
of
PmrA
being
phosphorylated
from
acetyl
phosphate
because
acetyl
phosphate
has
been
shown
to
serve
as
phosphoryl
donor
to
several
response
regulators
when
their
cognate
sensors
are
absent
(
see
Wolfe
,
2005
for
a
review
)
.

Interestingly
,
one
of
these
conserved
residues
was
a
histidine
at
position
35
.

Four
of
the
nine
conserved
amino
acids
in
the
periplasmic
domain
of
PmrB
are
glutamic
acid
residues
,
which
also
could
be
subjected
to
changes
in
protonation
upon
variations
in
the
pH
of
their
surroundings
.

Indeed
,
the
pKa
of
one
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
of
the
regulatory
protein
TraM
is
approximately7
.
7
in
the
folded
protein
(
Lu
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

The
levels
of
phosphorylated
PmrA
are
determined
by
the
balance
of
the
autokinase
+
phosphotransferase
activity
of
PmrB
and
PmrB
'
s
phosphatase
activity
towards
phospho
-
PmrA
.

What
role
could
the
pH
-
dependent
activation
of
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
play
in
Salmonella
'
s
lifestyle
?

However
,
the
effects
of
Mlc
on
hilD
expression
and
bacterial
invasiveness
were
not
seen
in
the
hilE
mutant
,
and
hilE
expression
was
increased
in
the
mlc
mutant
,
which
suggests
that
Mlc
exerts
positive
effects
on
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
by
reducing
the
expression
of
HilE
,
which
is
known
to
down
-
regulate
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
through
direct
interaction
with
HilD
.

Figure
1C
shows
that
SL1344
killed
42
%
of
the
macrophages
,
whereas
SR1304
killed
only
16
%
of
the
macrophages
4h
after
infection
,
which
demonstrates
that
the
mlc
gene
plays
an
important
role
in
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
cytotoxicity
.

To
identify
the
target
gene
in
SPI1
that
is
regulated
by
Mlc
,
the
expression
patterns
of
the
SPI1
-
regulatory
genes
,
which
include
hilA
,
invF
,
hilC
and
hilD
,
were
examined
by
primer
extension
analysis
of
total
RNA
from
SL1344
and
SR1304
grown
statically
to
the
exponential
phase
.

However
,
hilC
expression
was
unchanged
(
Figure
2A
)
.

(
20
)
have
found
that
HilE
plays
an
important
regulatory
role
in
the
expression
of
the
Salmonella
-
invasive
phenotype
by
affecting
hilA
transcription
through
direct
interaction
with
HilD
.

The
requirement
of
hilE
for
Mlc
function
was
reflected
in
the
levels
of
hilD
transcription
.

We
performed
a
primer
extension
assay
of
total
RNA
isolated
from
SL1344
grown
to
exponential
phase
in
static
culture
,
using
the
primer
described
by
Baxter
and
Jones
(
18
)
,
to
discover
which
promoter
is
regulated
by
Mlc
.

Using
a
primer
extension
assay
with
the
hilE5
primer
(
Table
2
)
,
the
promoter
of
hilE
,
which
is
designated
as
P3
,
was
newly
identified
;
this
promoter
initiates
335
nucleotides
upstream
of
the
translation
start
site
of
hilE
(
Figure
4B
,
lane
1
)
.

The
activity
of
the
purified
Mlc
-
His6
protein
was
verified
with
the
control
gel
mobility
shift
experiment
employing
the
Salmonella
ptsG
DNA
fragment
that
contains
the
known
Mlc
-
binding
site
(
data
not
shown
)
.

These
results
imply
that
multiple
regulatory
pathways
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
hilE
and
hilD
by
carbohydrates
.

It
is
well
known
that
SPI1
is
required
for
the
invasion
of
host
cells
and
induction
of
macrophage
apoptosis
(
2
,
3
,
40
)
.

This
regulatory
cascade
implies
that
the
reduced
invasive
phenotype
of
mlc
mutant
is
the
result
of
hilD
repression
,
which
affects
both
hilA
and
invF
expression
(
Figures
1
and
2
)
.

However
,
this
length
of
5
'
-
UTR
has
been
observed
in
other
SPI1
regulators
.

The
results
presented
in
this
study
support
the
notion
that
hilE
expression
is
activated
as
a
result
of
Mlc
sequestration
by
unphosphorylated
EIICBGlc
in
the
presence
of
glucose
.

Thus
,
carbon
metabolism
sensed
by
PhoB
/
R
may
also
affect
hilE
expression
(
22
)
,
and
this
may
be
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
elevated
hilE
expression
in
the
presence
of
carbohydrates
in
the
mlc
mutant
(
Figure
6A
)
.

The
effects
of
various
sugars
on
the
differential
regulation
of
SPI1
genes
require
further
investigation
to
understand
their
roles
in
Salmonella
pathogenesis
.

Further
sequence
analysis
revealed
a
palindrome
of
55
bp
with
the
potential
to
form
a
stem
-
loop
structure
situated
in
the
intergenic
region
between
salR
and
05SSU0942
,
which
may
function
as
a
transcriptional
terminator
.

On
the
other
hand
,
when
genomic
DNA
was
used
as
a
template
,
all
these
primer
pairs
yielded
the
expected
PCR
products
(
Fig

)
.

Construction
of
DeltasalKR

To
check
this
suspected
mutant
,
Southern
hybridization
analyses
were
employed
using
probes
of
SpcR
gene
,
an
internal
fragment
of
salKR
,
and
pUC18
,
respectively
.

In
the
suspected
mutant
,
a
3
.
6
kb
restriction
fragment
hybridized
with
the
SpcR
probe
(
Fig
.
3B
,
lane
2
)
,
while
no
hybridization
signal
was
detected
when
the
internal
fragment
of
salKR
and
pUC18
served
as
the
probes
(
Fig
.
3C
and
3D
,
lane
2
)
.

Five
out
of
six
piglets
succumbed
to
the
lethal
infections
of
CDeltasalKR
and
died
,
with
median
survival
times
of
2
to
3
days
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
mutant
-
inoculated
group
,
no
mutant
bacteria
could
be
recovered
from
any
of
the
examined
tissue
specimens
.

Similarly
,
we
observed
that
pst
(
05SSU0451
)
is
down
-
regulated
in
DeltasalKR
whose
survival
in
the
bloodstream
is
drastically
affected
(
Fig
.

)
.

However
,
they
did
not
provide
sufficient
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
prediction
of
89K
PAI
which
was
largely
based
on
the
results
of
bioinformatical
analysis
,
and
the
functions
of
the
vast
majority
of
genes
encoding
within
the
89K
island
remain
largely
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
we
carried
out
a
detailed
structural
and
functional
analysis
of
a
unique
two
-
component
regulatory
system
designated
SalK
/
SalR
which
is
located
in
the
putative
89K
PAI
.

Moreover
,
PCR
analysis
using
primers
amplifying
the
salKR
locus
also
demonstrated
that
this
TCSTS
is
specific
to
Chinese
epidemic
outbreak
strains
of
SS2
(
data
not
shown
)
,
implying
its
tight
linkage
to
the
virulence
of
this
new
emerging
pathogenic
species
.

It
is
known
that
TCSTSs
are
often
implicated
in
the
regulation
of
the
direct
downstream
genes
.

For
those
members
belonging
to
putative
transcriptional
operons
,
microarray
results
showed
that
most
of
those
genes
cotranscribed
with
them
were
also
down
-
regulated
to
a
various
degree
,
although
under
the
threshold
of
2
.

Secondly
,
some
of
the
TCSTSs
of
S
.
pneumoniae
were
suggested
to
be
involved
in
key
processes
of
pathogenesis
,
such
as
autolysis
and
cell
-
cell
signaling
[
52
]
,
SalK
/
SalR
might
regulate
similar
processes
in
Chinese
SS2
virulent
isolates
.

More
importantly
,
accumulated
evidence
suggests
that
some
of
the
known
virulent
factors
are
not
requisite
for
the
full
virulence
of
SS2
,
as
the
absence
of
one
or
more
of
these
proteins
in
isolates
from
infected
animals
cannot
necessarily
be
associated
with
a
lack
of
virulence

Discussion

When
we
examined
the
-
10
and
-
35
positions
of
the
promoters
studied
here
relative
to
the
transcriptional
start
sites
identified
previously
[
24
]
,
these
promoters
did
not
appear
to
contain
sigmaE
consensus
sequences
.

One
powerful
approach
to
dissect
the
interaction
between
pathogen
and
host
is
the
use
of
simple
infection
models
.

We
developed
a
high
-
throughput
killing
assay
using
C
.
elegans
as
a
host
,
which
will
be
appropriate
for
a
systematic
screen
of
mutant
libraries
of
any
P
.
aeruginosa
isolate
of
interest
.

High

It
was
reported
earlier
that
relatively
high
-
throughput
screening
procedures
performed
on
plates
could
be
used
to
identify
virulence
factors
in
various
pathogens
such
as
Staphylococcus
aureus
[
32
]
,
P
.
aeruginosa
[
8
]
or
Serratia
marcescens
[
33
]
.

Evaluation
of
virulence
was
based
upon
the
number
of
live
worms
recovered
after
24
h
exposure
to
bacteria
.

Under
our
assay
conditions
,
more
than
90
%
of
the
worms
grown
on
E
.
coli
were
still
alive
after
24
h
.

Screening
the
TB
Transposon
Library
for

Attenuated
in
Virulence

CheB2
has
been
proposed
to
be
an
essential
component
for
an
optimal
chemotactic
response
[
21
]
.

In
the
remaining
mutants
,
one
contained
a
transposon
insertion
in
PA5479
,
which
encodes
a
protein
similar
to
GltP
from
E
.
coli
,
a
glutamate
-
aspartate
carrier
protein
.

In
order
to
compare
our
liquid
assay
with
the
established
C
.
elegans
slow
killing
assay
,
we
compared
the
lethality
of
the
TB
strain
with
the
previously
tested
PA14
strain
.

We
observed
that
both
strains
kill
worms
with
similar
efficiency
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Each
of
the
12
group
1A
mutants
derived
from
TB
was
further
tested
in
the
slow
killing
assay
.

We
wished
to
determine
if
our
selected
mutants
showed
a
reduction
in
their
capacity
to
adhere
to
a
biological
surface
such
as
the
human
epithelial
cell
line
16HBE14o
-
.

Motility
is
also
an
important
factor
for
P
.
aeruginosa
colonization
and
spread
.

In
addition
,
we
engineered
a
similar
cheB2
mutation
in
the
P
.
aeruginosa
PA14
strain
,
yielding
PA140173i
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
,
and
observed
similar
virulence
attenuation
on
C
.
elegans
(
Figure
S3
)
.

This
further
confirmed
the
virulence
phenotype
of
a
cheB2
mutant
and
indicated
that
it
is
not
a
TB
strain
-
specific
trait
.

Infection
with
the
complemented
strain
TB0173sp2B2
resulted
in
60
%
dead
by
day

(
6
of
10
;
P
=
0
,
0018
,
Fisher
'
s
exact
test
)
(
Figure
4A
)
.

Surviving
mice
infected
with
the
cheB2
mutant
showed
a
significantly
less
troubled
body
condition
from
days
3
to
6
post
infection
(
P
<
0

01
,
Mann

)
than
surviving
mice
infected
with
the
wild
type
strain
indicating
that
the
former
group
recovered
earlier
than
the
latter
(
Figure
4B
)
.

It
is
worth
noting
that
a
mutant
affected
in
the
gacA
gene
,
previously
identified
in
the
slow
killing
assay
,
appeared
to
be
attenuated
in
our
liquid
-
based
killing
assay
.

We
tested
additional
virulence
and
motility
related
phenotypes
including
C
.
elegans
slow
killing
,
swarming
and
swimming
motility
,
or
adherence
to
human
cells
(
Table
1
)
.

The
cheB2
mutant
was
also
found
to
have
reduced
adhesive
capabilities
to
bronchial
epithelial
cells
(
Figure
S1
)
.

The
cheB1
mutant
virulence
is
not
attenuated
in
the
slow
killing
assay
.

Several
tissues
participate
in
a
coordinated
defense
against
microbial
infection
.

Secondly
,
specialized
hemocytes
participate
in
phagocytosis
and
encapsulation
of
foreign
intruders
.

In
contrast
,
the
Imd
pathway
mainly
responds
to
Gram
-
negative
bacterial
infections
and
controls
different
AMP
genes
(
e
.
g
.
,
Diptericin
)
via
the
activation
of
the
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
transactivator
Relish
(
Rel
)
[
3
,
4
,

]
.

We
have
isolated
several
Erwinia
carotovora
strains
,
such
as
Ecc15
,
for
their
capacity
to
persist
in
the
Drosophila
larval
gut
and
to
trigger
a
strong
systemic
immune
response
following
oral
infection
[
8
]
.

Here
we
report
an
in
vivo
analysis
of
P
.
entomophila
virulence
to
both
Drosophila
larvae
and
adult
flies
following
natural
oral
infection
.

No
killing
of
either
larvae
or
adults
was
observed
with
a
culture
filtrate
derived
from
the
avirulent
P
.
entomophila
strain
carrying
a
Tn5
transposon
in
the
gacA
gene
[
9
]
.

The
protein
profile
for
wild
-
type
P
.
entomophila
supernantant
(
Figure
1C
,
lane

)
shows
a
major
protein
band
at
51
kDa
and
several
minor
bands
.

Studies
in
other
bacteria
have
shown
that
AprD
,
E
,
and
F
participate
in
the
elaboration
of
a
Type
I
transporter
required
for
AprA
secretion
to
the
external
medium
[
17
]
.

To
investigate
the
connection
between
activation
of
the
Imd
pathway
and
the
outcome
of
P
.
entomophila
infection
in
more
detail
,
we
focused
our
analysis
on
the
adult
stage
when
it
is
easier
to
monitor
survival
.

We
thus
compared
resistance
to
P
.
entomophila
infection
of
flies
that
were
previously
either
orally
infected
with
Ecc15
(
to
activate
a
local
immune
response
)
or
pricked
with
Ecc15
(
to
activate
a
systemic
immune
response
)
.

In
these
flies
,
the
Imd
pathway
was
not
constitutively
active
in
the
gut
but
could
be
induced
upon
oral
bacterial
infection
similarly
to
the
wild
-
type
situation
(
Figure
S3A
)
.

This
response
could
be
interpreted
as
anticipation
of
possible
breaching
of
the
gut
barrier
.

Since
gacA
mutants
did
not
persist
in
imd
-
deficient
mutant
hosts
,
we
speculate
that
this
persistence
-
promoting
factor
provides
general
protection
against
gut
intestinal
conditions
rather
than
a
specific
protection
against
the
fly
immune
response
.

The
genome
of
P
.
entomophila
contains
several
genes
encoding
putative
insecticidal
toxins
(
e
.
g
.
,
Tc
toxins
,
hemolysins
,
and
lipopeptides
)
.

We
have
developed
a
powerful
experimental
framework
that
combines
competitive
selection
and
microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
to
comprehensively
reveal
the
genetic
basis
of
bacterial
behaviors
.

Quantitative
Analysis
of
Selection
within
the
Pool
of
Mutants

The
ORF
intensities
from
five
hybridizations
of
the
maximally
diverse
unselected
library
(
Dataset
S1
)
are
used
as
a
statistical
reference
to
quantify
the
degree
of
enrichment
or
depletion
after
the
library
is
exposed
to
a
selection
of
interest
.

The
amplification
of
transposon
insertion
sites
from
a
small
sample
of
these
mutants
showed
that
the
nonmotile
phenotype
is
the
result
of
a
single
gene
disruption
in
each
mutant
.

We
observed
that
some
false
positives
were
indeed
due
to
hitchhiking
,
but
others
were
due
to
polar
effects
of
transposon
insertions
on
downstream
genes
within
operons
.

Bacteriophage
chi
infects
E
.
coli
by
attaching
to
and
traveling
along
flagellar
filaments
[
24
]
.

CCW
flagellar
rotation
and
the
correct
pattern
of
grooves
on
the
surface
of
the
flagellum
are
thought
to
drive
chi
-
phage
down
the
filament
to
the
surface
of
the
membrane
,
very
similar
to
how
a
nut
follows
the
grooves
of
a
rotating
bolt
[
25
]
.

Because
the
genetic
basis
of
swarming
is
not
well
characterized
,
this
behavior
is
well
suited
for
comprehensive
analysis
using
our
approach
.

A
single
round
of
enrichment
consisted
of
inoculating
our
library
of
E
.
coli
mutants
onto
the
center
of
agar
plates
,
incubating
the
plates
to
allow
the
cells
to
migrate
outward
from
the
site
of
inoculation
,
and
transferring
bacteria
from
the
original
area
of
inoculation
to
a
fresh
plate
.

These
observations
indicate
that
the
chemotaxis
sensory
system
and
flagellar
switching
have
an
effect
on
,
but
are
not
critical
for
,
surface
motility
.

disrupt
the
RcsF
-
-
>
RcsC
-
-
>
RcsD
-
-
>

phosphorelay
cascade
,
the
phosphorylation
of
RcsB
cannot
be
fully
reversed
in
the
absence
of
RcsC
phosphatase
activity
,
as
observed
by
the
reduced
flhDC
-
lacZ
expression
and
motility
exhibited
by
rcsC
and
rcsD
mutants
(
Figure
4
)
.

First
,
chi
-
phage
infectivity
assays
with
DeltayhjH
mutants
showed
comparable
levels
of
infection
to
cheR
mutants
(
which
exhibit
CCW
flagellar
rotation
bias
)
in
contrast
to
the
reduced
sensitivity
displayed
by
cheZ
mutants
(
which
have
CW
flagellar
rotation
bias
)
,
consistent
with
the
z
-
scores
of
our
chi
-
phage
selection
(
Figure
5E
)
.

Together
,
these
results
indicate
that
the
yhjH
gene
product
is
involved
with
the
frequency
of
flagellar
motor
switching
,
a
process
that
is
among
the
remaining
puzzles
in
bacterial
chemotaxis
[
45
]
.

We
can
dissect
the
genetic
network
context
in
which
newly
identified
genes
function
by
making
libraries
of
double
mutants
in
which
a
transposon
library
is
constructed
in
the
background
of
a
mutation
of
interest
.

In
a
genome
-
wide
effort
to
identify
suppressors
of
swimming
defects
,
additional
libraries
of
transposon
insertional
mutants
were
created
in
genetic
backgrounds
containing
gene
deletions
of
interest
.

This
finding
is
consistent
with
a
recent
report
in
which
the
inactivation
of
ycgR
was
observed
to
improve
motility
of
yhjH
mutants
[
48
]
.

Suppressor
mutations
identified
in
the
Deltahns
background
are
shown
and
discussed
in
Figure
S8
,
and
the
microarray
results
can
be
found
in
Dataset
S12
.

YegE
and
YfgF
both
contain
an
EAL
domain
C
-
terminal
to
a
GGDEF
domain
(
Figure
6G
)
.

The
arrangement
of
these
genes
in
an
operon
suggests
that
they
may
function
together
.

We
found
that
swarming
was
not
impaired
in
either
the
fimS
mutant
or
the
mutants
with
fimbria
locked
in
phase
ON
,
indicating
that
fimbria
expression
does
not
interfere
with
swarming
motility
(
Figure
S11C
)
.

ZnuA
and
ZnuC
are
part
of
a
high
-
affinity
zinc
uptake
system
.

The
role
of
yfiM
,
a
novel
uncharacterized
gene
that
shows
sequence
similarity
to
a
lipoprotein
,
is
not
clear
at
this
point
.

Microbes
account
for
half
the
world
'
s
biomass
and
are
the
most
widely
distributed
organisms
on
the
planet
.

In
this
study
,
we
confirmed
our
findings
by
functional
analyses
of
individual
mutants
,
which
revealed
high
levels
of
sensitivity
and
low
rates
of
false
positives
.

Moreover
,
the
vancomycin
resistance
phenotype
makes
this
strain
more
of
a
risk
to
handle
in
the
laboratory
.

To
avoid
these
issues
,
most
laboratories
use
strain
OG1
or
its
close
derivatives

(

family
.

We
found
232
kb
of

unique
sequences
distributed
in
48
regions
ranging
from
101
bp
to
approximately
49
kb
in

Using
the

as
well
as

.

Surprisingly
,
the
genomes
align
syntenically
,
as
shown
in

,
despite
the
fact
that
25
%
of
the

that

[

]
and
it
has
been
postulated
that
domain

may
help
bacteria
escape
the

.

A
hypothesis
that
the
number
of
repeats
may
be
proportional
to
the
depth
of
the
peptidoglycan
has
been
proposed
[

.

OG1RF
does
not
contain

it

.

When
compared
to
V583
,
the
sequence

in

appears
to
be
as
low
as

We
did

Two

were
found
in

one

compared
nine

The
mutation
leading
to
rifampicin
resistance
was
identified
in
the
rpoB
gene
by
Ozawa

Mutations
in
this
region
have
been
associated
with
fusidic

resistance
in
Staphylococcus

,
and
thus
the

is
likely
the
cause
of
the

in

However
,
SpeB
has
also
been

to
cleave
a
range
of
GAS
proteins
such
as
the
fibrinogen
-
binding
M1

Sda1
[

]
,
and
thus
possibly
interfere
with
the
proven
virulence
functions
of
these
bacterial
factors
.

The
precise
role
(
s
)
of
SpeB
throughout
the
course
of
infection
are
undoubtedly
complex
,
and
not
surprisingly
,
different
studies
using
different
in
vivo
animal
models
have
produced
seemingly
contradictory
results
[
19
]
-
[
21
]
.

This
strain
-
specific
variation
is
highlighted
in
a
recent
work
by
Dmitriev
et
al
.

It
is
in
the
light
of
the
current
uncertainty
surrounding
RopB
and
its
role
in
virulence
that
we
sought
to
investigate
the
role
of
this
transcriptional
regulator
in
the
serotype
M1T1
GAS
background
that
is
the
leading
agent
of
severe
human
infection
.

This
analysis
begins
with
a
naturally
-
occuring
mutation
in
ropB
identified
in
one
such
strain
.

GAS
strain
5628
and
its
isogenic
mutants
5628R
+
and
5628RDeltaSpeB
were
grown
in
THB
,
and
the
OD600
was
measured
over
time
.

C57BL6
/
J
mice
were
subcutaneously
infected
with
the
SpeB
-
positive
strain
5628R
+
.

This
finding
reveals
that
when
SpeB
-
negative
colonies
are
selected
for
in
vivo
,
this
selection
is
predominantly
a
phenomenon
associated
with
CovR
/
S
inactivation
.

The
two
strains
containing
a
truncated
RopB
(
5628
and
5448R
-
)
demonstrated
similarly
reduced
virulence
compared
to
the
two
strains
containing
a
full
-
length
RopB
(
5628R
+
and
5448
)
(
Fig
.
4B
)
,
confirming
that
inactivation
of
RopB
results
in
decreased
virulence
in
systemic
infection
.

We
have
shown
that
in
M1T1
GAS
,
when
the
covR
/
S
locus
is
intact
and
DNase
Sda1
activity
is
unaffected
,
ropB
point
mutation
results
in
reduced
virulence
in
vivo
,
despite
inactivation
of
SpeB
activity
.

Furthermore
,
the
switch
to
a
SpeB
-
negative
phenotype
appeared
to
occur
exclusively
through
mutations
in
covR
/
S
.

We
show
that
mutants
of
hfq
and
smpB
directly
or
indirectly
modulate
at
least
20
%
and
4
%
of
all
possible
Salmonella
proteins
,
respectively
,
with
limited
correlation
between
transcription
and
protein
expression
.

Hfq
is
a
highly
conserved
protein
encoded
within
many
bacterial
genomes
and
at
least
one
archaeon
genome
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
.

In
bacteria
,
Hfq
functions
as
a
post
-
transcriptional
regulator
that
modulates
the
stability
and
translation
of
mRNAs
chiefly
by
facilitating
sRNA
-
mRNA
interactions
[
1
]
,
[
4
]
,
[
9
]
.

In
another
study
,
a
smpB
mutant
of
Salmonella
Typhimurium
exhibited
defects
in
intra
-
macrophage
survival
,
a
model
of
Salmonella
pathogenesis
[
23
]
.

Collectively
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
Hfq
and
SmpB
are
essential
for
regulating
virulence
by
controlling
translation
of
key
components
.

The

was
assessed
via
hypothesis
testing
,
specifically
a
comprehensive
ANOVA
scheme
included
in
the
computer
program
DAnTE
[
30
]
.

Considering
that
we
observe
36
%
(
1621
orfs
)
of
the
entire
Salmonella
proteome
(
4450
orfs
)
and
that
50
%
(
781
orfs
)
of
this
observed
proteome
(
1621
orfs
)
is
modulated
by
Hfq
,
it
would
be
expected
that
a
significant
portion
of
the
unobserved
Salmonella
proteome
(
2829
orfs
)
would
also
be
regulated
by
Hfq
,
thus
our
assertion
that
the
approximately20
%
value
may
very
well
represent
an
underestimation
.

This
category
encompasses
sub
-
categories
including
adaptations
to
atypical
conditions
,
cell
adhesion
,
pathogenesis
,
chemotaxis
and
motility
,
detoxification
,
toxin

and

,

and

.

[

investigated
the
proteome
of
an
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
using
2D
gel
analysis
,
and
found
approximately70
differentially

proteins
in
early
stationary
phase
.

The
exception
was
the
SPI
-
1
protein
SipA
under
LB
Stat
growth
conditions
.

Our
proteomics
results
showed
that
HtrA
protein
levels
were
strongly
up
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
relative
to
wildtype
in
LB
Log
,
while
OsmY
and
STM1513
were
strongly
down
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
relative
to
wildtype
in
AMM
-

and
LB
Stat
respectively
.

Of
the
781
proteins
and
492
transcripts
regulated
by
Hfq
,
113
genes
overlapped
both
sets
.

We
observed
changes
in
expression
for
approximately50
%
of
the
observed
Salmonella
Typhimurium
proteome
based
on
an
ANOVA
analysis
(
p
<

.

)
(
Table
S1
)
.

The
proteins
affected
represent
a
broad
spectrum
of
Salmonella
proteins
required
for
many
biological
processes
including
general
metabolism
,
the
translational
machinery
,
stress
response
,
and
virulence
-
assocaited
processes
as
described
next
.

General

Proteome

suggested
Hfq
regulates
nucleoside
(
DeoABC
)
and
nucleotide
metabolism
(
CarAB
,

)
under
AMM
conditions
,
as
well
as
regulates
ribose
metabolism
and
transport
(
RbsABK
)
under
AMM
-

.

Hfq
also
appears
to
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
the
translational
machinery
itself
presumably
as
a
feedback
mechanism
to
maintain
tight
control
over
the
amount
of
ribosomal

.

Among

were

and

,
CheY
,
and
CheW
.

Both
microarray

and

showed
that

were
unchanged
for
pduA
and
pduE
genes
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
compared
to
the
wildtype
strain
(
Figure
5
)
,
thus
showing
that
Hfq
represses
translation
in
these
two
environmental
conditions
.

We
note
however
that
a
more
detailed
and
rigorous
analysis
is
required
to
confirm
the
speculated
global
regulatory
role
of
SmpB
.

Summary

Using
a
sample
-
matched
procedure
our
strategy
simultaneously
measures
changes
in
global
transcript
and
protein
abundance
levels
allowing
for
a
clear
distinction
between
the
transcriptional
and
post
-
transcriptional
effects
of
Hfq
or
SmpB
.

Furthermore
,
our
strategy
requires
no
tagging
and
or
isolation
of
Hfq
or
SmpB
precluding
the
possibility
of
spurious
results
introduced
by
tagging
and
or
co
-
immunoprecipitation
processes
.

Most
recently
high
-
throughput
pyrosequencing
(
HTPS
)
was
used
to
detect
message
and
sRNA
bound
to
Hfq
following
immunoprecipitation
[
10
]
.

During
growth
in
rich
media
approximately
14
%
of
all
proteins
observed
showed
differences
in
abundance
where
as
in
acidic
minimal
media
the
result
was
approximately21
%
.

Upregulation
of
genes
encoding
different
types
of
nutrient
uptake
systems
further
emphasized
the
differences
in
nutritional
requirements
of
the
two
bacteria
in
the
same
insect
host
.

The
published
genome
sequence
of
Photorhabdus
luminescens
TT01
strain
indicates
that
virulence
genes
are
encoded
within
a
number
of
pathogenicity
islands
located
on
the
bacterial
chromosome

To
isolate
bacterial
mRNA
transcripts
preferentially
induced
during

of
the
insect

to
the

,
normalized

cDNAs
were
enriched
by
hybridization
to
biotinylated
bacterial
genomic
DNA
that
had
been
pre
-
hybridized
with
rRNA

and
in

normalized
cDNAs
.

The
enriched
cDNAs
representing

-
induced
genes
,
which
were
either
lower
in
abundance
or
absent
in
48
h
in
vitro
bacterial
cultures
were
then
cloned
into
a
TA
cloning
vector
to
construct
in

enriched
cDNA
libraries
.

Only
a
small
number
of
transcripts
were
induced
in
both
bacteria
,
and
most
of
them
corresponded
to
genes
required
for
stress

employed

the

.

These
transcriptional

data
,
combined
with
previous

performed
by
our

revealed
that

Results
and

As
anticipated
,
clusters
of
genes
associated
with
LPS

and
toxin

showed
variations
.

AppChip2
was
designed
using
the
complete

sequence
from
the

L20
.

Out
of
these
28
genes
,
20
can
be
found
in
two
major
regions
of
the
genome
:

for

,
while
6
are
located

.

Following

and
analysis
,
86
.
7
%
of
all
coding
sequences
included
on
AppChip2
could
be
detected
during
our
experiments
,
and
150
genes
were
significantly
differentially
expressed
in

when
their
level
of
expression
was
compared
to
that
seen
in

,
with
a
FDR
of
4

25
%
over
the
course
of
three
hybridizations
:
72
of
these
were
up

regulated
,
while
78
were
down
-
regulated
.

A
large
number
of
genes
encoding
"
Hypothetical

were
differentially

.

Five
of
these
were
up

in

(

Whether
this

also
the
case
for

will
have
to
be

Both

the

it
requires
Fe2
+
as
a
cofactor
[

]
.

This
is
not
surprising
considering
that
there
is
extensive
hemorrhage
and
tissue
destruction
,
caused
most
probably
by
the
secretion
of
Apx
toxins
.

Hfq
is
an
RNA
chaperone
that
acts
as
a
post

transcriptional
riboregulator
[

]
.

The
down
-
regulation
of
genes
involved
in
capsule
synthesis
could
potentially
lead
to
the
production
of
a
thinner
capsule
on
the
surface
of
bacteria
,
thereby
unmasking
potential
adhesins
.

The
apf
promoter
was
shown
to
be
active
in
vitro
during
adhesion
experiments
to
primary
epithelial
cells
,
and
in
vivo
early
in
the
infection
process
[

]
.

Here
,
we
report
that
genes
apfB
and
apfC
,
coding
for
the
type
IV
pilin
biogenesis
proteins
ApfB
and
ApfC
,
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
during
natural
infection
by
an
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
isolate
.

Interestingly
,
another
gene
that
could
share
similar
functions
was
also
up
-
regulated
.

Two
operon
structures
that
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
during
the
acute
phase
of
the
disease
could
give
some
insight
into
the
environment
the
bacteria
encounters
in
the
host
,
and
are
the
main
reason
why
the
"
Transport
and
Binding
Protein
"
functional
class
is
so
prominently
represented
in
our
list
of
up

regulated
genes
.

It
was
also
recently
shown
that
catabolism
of
maltose
provides
a
competitive
advantage
to
pathogenic
and
commensal
E

strains
in
the
gut
[

.

While
ascorbate
use
has
not
been
linked
to
bacterial
virulence
before
,
it
has
been
shown
on
multiple
occasions
that
genes
involved
in
anaerobic
metabolism
are
important
for
the
virulence
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
[
10
,
61
-

]
.

The
irp
(
iron
responsive
protein
)
gene
codes
for
a
predicted
TonB
-
dependant
receptor
,
possibly
involved
in
hemin
transport
.

While
it
was
first
identified
for
its
hemagglutination
properties
[
72
]
,
FHA
can
bind
carbohydrates
,
heparan
sulphate
and
integrin
[

.

Conclusions

These
three
genes
,
namely
fhaB
(
APL
_
0959
)
,
irp
(
APL
_
0919
)
and
APL
_
0920
,
could
all
represent
excellent
candidates
for
the
development
of
a
protective
cross
-
serotype
subunit
vaccine
against
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
.

To
survive
in
the
host
environment
,
Salmonella
enterica
uses
a
type
III
secretion
system
and
effector
proteins
,
which
are
activated
by
the
SsrA
-
SsrB
two
-
component
system
in
response
to
the
host
environment
.

To
better
understand
the
phenomenon
of
regulatory
evolution
in
S
.
enterica
,
we
defined
the
SsrB
regulon
and
asked
how
this
transcription
factor
interacts
with
the
cis
-
regulatory
region
of
target
genes
.

It
is
generally
accepted
that
SPI
-
2
was
acquired
by
Salmonella
enterica
after
divergence
from
S
.
bongori
,
providing
a
useful
pedigree
to
study
regulatory
evolution
influenced
by
SsrB
.

Next
,
we
performed
a
Clusters
of
Orthologous
Groups
(
COG
)
analysis
[
22
]
on
the
118
genes
that
had
an
ortholog
in
the
annotated
genome
of
S
.

From
this
analysis
,
62
of
256
SsrB
binding
peaks
(
24
.
3
%
)
occurred
within
genomic
islands
(
Figure
2B
)
.

To
generate
a
consensus
set
of
SsrB
regulated
genes
,
we
performed
an
analysis
to
identify
operons
in
the
S
.

SsrB
binds
to
six
promoters
within
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island

We
used
the
PhoP
response
regulator
from
E
.
coli
as
a
control
because
a
DNA
recognition
sequence
for
it
was
known
[
28
]
.

We
identified
variations
of
this
motif
within
footprinted
regions
of
SsrB
-
regulated
promoters
[
25
]
,
,
however
sequence
degeneracy
made
it
difficult
to
precisely
map
the
input
functions
.

The
tsetse
fly
endosymbiont
Sodalis
glossinidius
contains
the
Sodalis
Symbiosis
Region
-
3
(
SSR
-
3
)
that
is
similar
in
content
and
synteny
with
the
S
.
enterica
SPI
-
2
locus
[
31
]
.

We
aligned
the
sequences
of
the
five
mapped
promoters
in
SPI
-
2
with
the
orthologous
SSR
-
3
regions
to
identify
local
conservation
.

Interestingly
,
two
copies
of
the
palindrome
occur
upstream
of
the
ssrA
-
ssrB
operon
in
S
.

Evaluation
of
the
heptamer
motif
in
the
palindrome
showed
high
similarity
to
the
motifs
identified
by
the
bacterial
one
-
hybrid
screen
and
the
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
experiments
(
Figure
4B
and
4D
)
,
giving
us
confidence
that
we
had
identified
the
major
recognition
module
for
transcriptional
input
by
SsrB
.

In
accord
with
a
previous
observation
[
26
]
,
there
was
not
a
strict
requirement
in
the
spacing
between
the
SsrB
binding
site
and
the
downstream
transcriptional
start
site
.

Therefore
,
we
compared
the
sequences
generated
upon
mutation
against
a
consensus
palindrome
matrix
generated
from
all
SPI
-
2
and
other
identified
putative
elements
.

Discussion

By
using
a
genetic
screening
strategy
together
with
functional
and
comparative
genomics
,
we
were
able
to
define
the
essential
SsrB
regulatory
element
as
being
an
18
-
bp
palindrome
with
a
conserved
7
-
4
-
7
internal
organization
.

As
a
result
of
our
mutational
analyses
we
conclude
that
so
long
as
the
orientation
of
a
single
heptamer
of
the
palindrome
is
conserved
with
respect
to
the
downstream
gene
,
SsrB
is
tolerant
of
degeneracy
in
the
adjacent
spacer
and
heptamer
sequences
.

Our
findings
also
suggest
that
dimerization
is
likely
required
for
transcriptional
activation
however
strong
recognition
by
one
monomer
may
stabilize
interaction
of
a
second
monomer
with
a
less
than
ideal
sequence
.

We
showed
that
the
SsrB
regulatory
palindrome
is
also
present
in
the
orthologous
SSR
-
3
island
of
the
endosymbiont
Sodalis
glossinidius
and
that
the
palindrome
evolved
in
Sodalis
can
act
as
a
cis
regulatory
input
function
in
Salmonella
.

To
the
contrary
,
high
local
conservation
in
the
promoters
evolved
in
Salmonella
and
Sodalis
was
the
crux
in
defining
the
functional
SsrB
input
among
stochastic
noise
.

Having
previously
reported
that
M1T1
Streptococcus
pyogenes
become
hypervirulent
in
mice
due
to
selection
of
mutants
in
the
covRS
regulatory
genes
,
we
set
out
to
dissect
the
impact
of
these
mutations
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
from
the
impact
of
other
adaptive
events
.

This
difference
in
buoyancy
can
be
attributed
to
differences
in
proteolytic
activity
(
WT
>
>
AP
)
that
may
degrade
many
surface
proteins
,
including
pilin
,
or
induce
changes
in
the
surface
charge
making
bacterial
aggregates
more
compact
.

The
concentrations
of
viable
WT
and
AP
bacteria
at
24
h
post
-
inoculation
remained
essentially
the
same
:
1
-
5x109
colony
-
forming
units
(
CFU
)
/
ml
vs
.
approximately2x109
CFU
/
ml
inoculum
.

Multiple
approaches
to
microarray
analysis
show
statistically
significant
and
biologically
relevant
differences
between
the
WT
and
AP
populations
in
vitro
and
in
vivo

Many
of
these
genes
encode
metabolic
enzymes
(
e
.
g
.
,
carbohydrate
metabolism
,
arginine
degradation
,
and
pyrimidine
biosynthesis
)
,
ribosomal
proteins
(
mostly
downregulated
)
,
and
sugar
or
peptide
transport
systems
,
reflecting
the
transition
from
a
carbohydrate
-
rich
laboratory
medium
to
a
protein
-
rich
,
oxygen
-
poor
subcutaneous
tissue
.

However
,
the
fold
-
change
in
SpeB
operon
transcription
level
largely
varied
across
the
four
experimental
conditions
,
ranging
from
a
2
.
2
-
fold
to
a
30
-
fold
downregulation
(
Table
3
)
.

NC
analysis
also
allowed
us
to
visualize
genomic
clusters
that
are
similarly
regulated
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
and
those
that
are
reciprocally
regulated
.

In
this
study
,
we
captured
dynamic
events
underlying
the
phenotypic
switch
resulting
from
this
population
restructuring
.

This
finding
is
in
agreement
with
studies
showing
that
the
CovRS
system
is
mainly
linked
to
the
regulation
of
virulence
factors
and
virulence
-
associated
pathways
[
19
]
,
[
20
]
,
[
24
]
,
[
26
]
,
[
27

,
[

]
,
[
52
]
,
[
53
]
,
[
54
]
,
[
55
]
.

The
downregulation
of
GRAB
makes
biological
sense
because
this
protein
binds
alpha
-
2
-
macroglobulin
in
blood
[
60
]
to
protect
the
bacteria
against
its
own
protease
,
SpeB
,
and
thus
the
bacteria
no
longer
need
to
express
high
levels
of
GRAB
when
SpeB
is
not
expressed
.

Finally
,
genes
encoding
the
antiphagocytic
M
protein
,
and
the
toxins
streptolysin
O
and
NADGH
were
among
few
genes
that
were
upregulated
in
all
conditions
except
WT
-
vitro
(
Fig
.
2
,
CC7
)
,
which
suggests
that
their
transcription
is
dependent
on
multiple
signals
,
including
signals
from
the
host
as
well
as
covS
-
dependent
cues
.

Although
our
microarray
studies
were
extensive
(
28
arrays
for
4
conditions
)
,
we
ran
qPCR
to
validate
the
microarray
findings
,
focusing
on
virulence
genes
that
are
biomarkers
of
the
bacterial
switch
to
a
hypervirulent
phenotype
.

The
use
of
multiple
microarray
analysis
strategies
and
the
integration
of
their
results
strengthened
this
study
since
each
strategy
has
advantages
and
disadvantages
.

In
bacteria
,
biochemical
pathways
,
virulence
systems
,
and
multimeric
proteins
are
often
encoded
next
to
each
other
by
chromosomally
contiguous
or
clustered
genes
[
64
]
,
[
65
]
.

However
,
the
degree
of
AP
invasiveness
might
vary
depending
on
the
route
of
infection
and
animal
model
[
15
]
.

This
dominant
SpeB
effect
may
explain
why
WT
bacteria
parish
in
vivo
even
though
they
partially
downregulate
SpeB
transcription
(
Table
3
)
.

This
study
is
a
first
step
towards
exploring
the
sociomicrobiology
of
invasive
GAS
in
vivo
.

Recently
,
the
novel
two
-
component
regulatory
system
Sak188
/
Sak189
was
identified
.

Streptococcus
agalactiae
(
group
B
streptococcus
)
is
an
important
cause
of
neonatal
invasive
infections
and
variety
of
diseases
in
human
and
animals
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
.

Subsequently
,
phosphoryl
group
is
transferred
to
RR
protein
resulting
in
conformational
changes
in
RR
molecule
.

Construction
of
the
strains
was
confirmed
by
PCR
and
nucleotide
sequencing
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Comparative
analysis
of
the
wild
-
type
strain
168
/
00
and
mutant
strains
revealed
no
difference
in
morphological
properties
.

Subsequently
,
bacterial
cell
lysates
and
secreted
proteins
after
2
hrs
and
5
hrs
of
growth
in
THB
were
analyzed
.

Effect

In

virulent

of
the

and

Intraperitoneal

of

mice
demonstrated
that

regulatory
protein
is
important
for
virulent
properties
of
S
.
agalactiae
.

We
present
neighbor
clustering
,
a
new
computational
method
for
further
analyzing
bacterial
microarray
data
that
combines
two
informative
characteristics
of
bacterial
genes
that
share
common
function
or
regulation
:
(
1
)
similar
gene
expression
profiles
(
i
.
e
.
,
co
-
expression
)
;
and
(
2
)
physical
proximity
of
genes
on
the
chromosome
.

This
method
identifies
statistically
significant
clusters
of
co
-
expressed
gene
neighbors
that
potentially
share
common
function
or
regulation
by
coupling
statistically
analyzed
gene
expression
profiles
with
the
chromosomal
position
of
genes
.

We
applied
this
method
to
our
own
data
and
to
those
of
others
,
and
we
show
that
it
identified
a
greater
number
of
differentially
expressed
genes
,
facilitating
the
reconstruction
of
more
multimeric
proteins
and
complete
metabolic
pathways
than
would
have
been
possible
without
its
application
.

Following
filtering
and
normalization
[
18
,
19
]
,
we
analyzed
data
from
four
biological
replicates
[
16
]
with
robust
summary
statistics
[
20
]
,
Bayesian
statistics
[
21
,
22
]
,
and
permutation
algorithms
[
19
]
to
identify
genes
differentially
expressed
with
significance
during
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
.

We
conducted
TaqMan
(
qRT
-
PCR
)
analysis
[
23
]
of
11
differentially
expressed
genes
to
validate
selected
microarray
hybridization
results
(
see
Table
S2
for
genes
and
primer
-
probe
sequences
)
.

Virulence
Factors

However
,
once
adhered
,
our
data
suggest
that
streptococci
downregulate
production
of
this
cytotoxin
,
presumably
to
prevent
further
host
tissue
destruction
that
could
interfere
with
adherence
.

The
speH
gene
(
spy1008
)
was
induced
,
and
the
remaining
genes
,
hypothetically
involved
in
replication
and
regulation
[
39
]
,
were
downregulated
.

A
total
of
56
of
the
original
79
significant
genes
became
components
of
significant
clusters
,
whereas
23
remained
unclustered
.

Each
of
the
11
neighbor
clusters
that
could
have
been
only
partially
identified
by
our
initial
analysis
alone
gained
gene
members
after
application
of
the
algorithms
and
became
more
complete
sets
of
functionally
related
genes
than
initially
identified
(
Table
3
)
.

Notably
,
the
remaining
ten
Type
I
clusters
were
composed
entirely
of
genes
that
individually
were
not
significant
;
however
,
after
applying
our
algorithms
,
the
combined
contribution
of
each
gene
resulted
in
a
significant
cluster
.

Based
on
the
Type
I
cluster
results
,
we
speculated
that
genes
contained
in
Type
II
clusters
might
be
related
by
function
or
regulation
.

We
note
,
however
,
that
despite
the
statistical
framework
with
which
groupings
are
assigned
,
experimental
evidence
is
necessary
to
confirm
functional
or
regulatory
relatedness
.

Together
with
the
identification
of
this
cluster
by
GenomeCrawler
,
these
results
prompted
us
to
study
this
cluster
and
the
contributions
of
the
gene
products
to
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
.

In
silico
sequence
inspection
identified
a
single
putative
promoter
sequence
upstream
of
spy0127
(
see
Table
S6
)
.

We
created
a
spy0129
deletion
mutant
in
strain
SF370
(
SF370Deltaspy0129
)
to
determine
if
genes
contained
within
the
spy0127
-
0130
cluster
were
directly
involved
in
adherence
to
pharyngeal
cells
.

The
genes
spy1724
,
spy1722
,
spy1721
,
and
spy1719
share
transcriptional
order
and
predicted
function
with
homologs
in
the
nusA
-
infB
protein
biosynthesis
operon
of
Bacillus
subtilis
and
Escherichia
coli
[
51
]
.

We
applied
the
statistical
analysis
and
the
GenomeCrawler
algorithms
to
data
from
a
recently
published
streptococcal
microarray
study
that
is
relevant
for
comparison
to
our
own
data
(
same
streptococcal
strain
,
similar
array
platform
)
[
57
]
.

We
applied
the
GenomeCrawler
algorithms
to
the
statistically
analyzed
dataset
,
which
identified
an
expanded
group
of
genes
(
107
versus
four
)
contained
within
36
statistically
significant
clusters
(
PK
<
0

;

)
.

The
long

FimA
)
fimbriae
have
been
extensively
studied
.

Two
distinct
fimbriae
are
found
on
the
surface
of
the

(
Dickinson

.

Coadhesion

require
the

of
Mfa1
with

(

.

The

FimA
and
Mfa1
are
inhibited
in
P
.
gingivalis
,
whereas
such
differences
are
not
found
in
gingipain
expression
.

In
this
study
,
it
is
demonstrated
that
FimR
is
a
positive
regulator
of
Mfa1
expression
.

Evidence
is
provided
that
unlike
FimR
-
dependent
fimA
expression
,
FimR
regulates
mfa1
expression
by
directly
binding
to
the
promoter
region
of
mfa1
.

Results

This
analysis
suggests
the
FimS
/
FimR
system
is
required
for
expression
of
both
major
and
minor
fimbriae
.

Density
of
protein
bands
was
determined
by
UVP
Bioimaging
System
(
UVP
,
CA
)
.

This
analysis
revealed
that
the
expression
of
the
fimA
and
mfa1
genes
was
consistent
at
the
mRNA
level
and
protein
level
(
Fig
.
1b
)
.

FimA
protein
was
not
detectable
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
while
a
50
%
lower
level
of
Mfa1
protein
was
found
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
compared
with
that
in
wild
-
type
strain
33277
.

The
same
transcriptional
start
site
was
identified
.

Binding
of
FimR
to
the
promoter
region
of
mfa1

To
investigate
the
role
of
phosphorylation
of
FimR
in
its
binding
to
the
mfa1
promoter
region
,
EMSA
experiments
were
also
performed
with
the
phosphorylated
rFimR
.

No
significant
difference
was
detected
in
the
level
of
DNA
binding
between
the
phosphorylated
rFimR
and
unphosphorylated
rFimR
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Although
most
target
genes
of
P
.
gingivalis
two
-
component
systems
are
unknown
,
the
role
of
the
FimS
/
FimR
in
expression
of
the
fimA
gene
is
well
defined
.

The
observations
that
FimR
binds
only
to
the
upstream
promoter
region
of
the
mfa1
gene
and
that
activity
of
the
downstream
promoter
is
inhibited
by
S
.
gordonii
,
S
.
sanguinis
and
S
.
mitis
(
Park
et
al
.
,
2006
)
imply
the
complexity
of
regulation
of
mfa1
expression
.

In
conclusion
,
P
.
gingivalis
fimbriae
play
a
predominant
role
in
the
attachment
of
the
organism
to
a
variety
of
oral
surfaces
(
Lamont
&
Jenkinson
,
2000
;
Amano
et
al
.
,
2004
)
,
although
other
surface
proteins
,
such
as
gingipains
,
may
also
be
involved
in
the
bacterial
colonization
(
Tokuda
et
al
.
,
1996
;
Chen
et
al
.
,
2001
)
.

Despite
its
long
use
,
the
reasons
for
its
stable
attenuation
have
not
yet
been
elucidated
.

In
another
study
,
Pascopella
et
al
.

While
writing
this
article
,
the
whole
genome
sequence
of
H37Ra
became
publicly
available
(
NC
_
009525
)
,
and
comparison
of
the
SNP
data
obtained
from
the
H37Ra
strain
used
in
our
laboratory
(
Table
S1
)
with
the
NC
_
009525
data
,
showed
that
some
differences
existed
between
the
H37Ra
strains
,
a
phenomenon
which
was
also
previously
observed
for
BCG
[
4
]
and
H37Rv
[
17
]
.

Figure
S1
shows
part
of
the
nucleotide
sequence
of
a
PCR
-
amplified
fragment
obtained
from
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
.

In
contrast
,
no
effects
on
the
virulence
were
observed
when
H37Ra
was
complemented
with
fadE5
(
Figure
2
)
or
rpsL
(
unpublished
data
)
.

For
M
.
tuberculosis
,
several
studies
have
described
a
link
between
the
inactivation
of
phoP
and
loss
of
virulence
,
suggesting
that
the
phoP
gene
is
required
for
intracellular
growth
of
M
.
tuberculosis
[
14
,
25
]
.

There
were
also
several
ppe
genes
that
seem
to
be
regulated
by
phoP
but
not
ppe68
[
21
]
.

Furthermore
,
rv3614c
-
rv3616c
were
reported
to
be
transiently
upregulated
in
the
phagosome
and
under
acidic
stress
[
38
]
.

With
its
well
documented
role
in
virulence
and
strong
T
cell
antigenicity
,
ESAT
-
6
is
one
of
the
most
important
proteins
of
M
.
tuberculosis
involved
in
host
pathogen
interaction
[
5
,
41
-
43
]
.

At
present
,
we
do
not
know
how
many
of
these
differences
actually
contribute
to
the
attenuation
of
H37Ra
,
and
it
also
remains
to
be
determined
how
many
differences
exist
among
the
various
H37Ra
strains
that
are
presently
used
in
the
worldwide
tuberculosis
research
laboratories
.

In
addition
,
the
genetic
overlap
unravelled
a
two
-
component
system
that
is
unique
for
the
genera
Photorhabdus
and
Yersinia
and
is
therefore
suggested
to
play
a
major
role
in
the
pathogen
-
insect
relationship
.

Some
of
them
might
have
been
selected
during
the
association
with
insects
and
then
adapted
to
pathogenesis
in
mammalian
hosts
.

Pathogenicity
as
well
as
symbiosis
plays
a
key
role
in
the
interaction
of
bacteria
with
their
hosts
including
invertebrates
.

Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
,
in
contrast
to
Y
.
pestis
,
has
been
shown
to
be
orally
toxic
to
flea
[
8
]
.

Furthermore
,
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
have
been
demonstrated
to
adhere
to
and
invade
cultivated
insect
cells
[
10
]
.

Thus
,
the
interaction
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
with
insects
is
an
important
link
in
the
ecological
range
of
bacteria
-
host
interactions
extending
from
entomopathogenic
to
humanpathogenic
bacteria
.

Nematode
reproduction
is
supported
by
the
bacteria
,
probably
by
providing
essential
nutrients
that
are
required
for
efficient
nematode
proliferation
[

.

Results
and
Discussion

Its
genome
size
is
exceeded
by
the
~
5
.
7
Mbp
genome
of
P
.
luminescens
encoding
4839
putative
proteins
[
24
]
.

In
contrast
,
P
.
luminescens
cells
are
primarily
restricted
to
symbiosis
with
the
nematode
species
H
.
bacteriophora
and
the
insect
larvae
as
hosts
,
thus
encountering
a
more
homeostatic
milieu
.

The
putative
target
genes
of
Plu0102
/
Plu0103
and
Ye4185
/
Ye4186
,
plu0104
and
ye4187
,
respectively
,
are
homologues
and
encode
putative
secreted
proteins
which
might
act
in
a
similar
,
yet
unknown
manner
.

They
produce
membrane
diffusible
signalling
molecules
,
acyl
homoserine
lactones
(
AHLs
)
,
which
are
sensed
by
the
receptor
/
regulator
LuxR
when
exceeding
a
threshold
concentration
.

Y
.
enterocolitica
possesses
a
typical
quorum
sensing
pair
of
homologues
,
YenI
/
YenR
(
YE1600
/
YE1599
)
,
and
it
has
recently
been
shown
that
swimming
and
swarming
motility
is
regulated
by
3
-
oxo
-
C6
-
AHL
and
C6
-
AHL
,
which
are
synthesized
by
YenI
[
34
]
.

The
DeltaluxS
mutant
also
showed
decreased
expression
of
virulence
factors
such
as
the
cytotoxic
protein
CcdB
,
the
hemolysin
secretion
protein
HlyD
(
Plu0635
)
,
and
the
toxin
ABC
transporter
subunits
RtxD
/
RtxB
.

It
is
discussed
that
the
AstS
/
AstR
-
system
prevents
or
delays
phenotypic
variation
by
protecting
the
cell
from
stress
[
18
]
.

Because
Y
.
enterocolitica
produces
the
corresponding
TCS
BvgS
/
BvgR
,
but
is
not
known
to
switch
to
another
phenotypic
variant
,
the
possible
role
of
UspA
in
global
regulation
still
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Phenotypic
variation
and
thus
the
switch
between
mutualism
and
pathogenicity
in
P
.
luminescens
is
proposed
to
be
regulated
by
a
Ner
-
like
and
a
HexA
-
like
regulator
that
repress
primary
variant
specific
genes
in
the
stage
of
the
secondary
variant
[
17
]
.

Therefore
,
an
UspC
mediated
stress
response
is
not
assumed
to
play
a
major
role
in
insect
pathogenicity
.

In
addition
to
phenotypes
that
affect
virulence
properties
indirectly
,
c
-
di
-
GMP
can
also
directly
regulate
virulence
factors
[
56
,
57
]
.

Remarkably
,
their
expression
is
induced
by
low
iron
concentration
as
encountered
in
the
insect
host
,
and
phlA
/
phlB
are
up
-
regulated
at
18degreesC
compared
to
28degreesC
in
Y
.

[

.

In
the
genome
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
only
three
complete
TPS
systems
are
present
,
namely
YE0479
/
YE0480
,
YE2407
/
YE2408
,
(
YE4084
)
YE4085
/
YE4086
,
and
YE3454
which
lacks
the
activator
partner
.

Recently
,
we
have
shown
that
a
luciferase
reporter
insertion
into
YE0480
is
induced
at
low
temperature
[
67
]
,
indicating
that
this
TPS
system
might
contribute
to
insect
pathogenicity
and
possibly
to
the
host
-
specificity
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

The
P
.
luminescens
genome
comprises
a
gene
cluster
encoding
RTX
proteins
,
namely
plu1330
-
1369
.

Adhesins
and
invasins

Defensive
mechanisms

Interestingly
,
none
of
these
genes
showed
significant
similarities
to
sequences
of
the
Y
.
enterocolitica
genome
.

More
than
twenty
colicin
/
pyocin
-
like
factors
and
putative
immunity
proteins
are
unique
to
P
.
luminescens
in
comparison
to
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Examples
are
the
product
of
plu4258
,
adjacent
to
a
gene
encoding
glutathione
transferase
(
plu4259
)
,
a
putative
steroid
monooxygenase
(
Plu4232
)
,
and
a
glycine
oxidase
(
Plu2242
)
,
all
of
which
have
no
counterparts
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

In
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
two
type
-
III
secretion
systems
(
T3SS
)
essential
for
virulence
in
the
mammalian
host
are
encoded
on
pYV
and
by
the
ysa
operon
(
YE3533
-
3561
)
[
23
,
82
]
.

Additionally
to
the
Sec
-
system
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
produces
a
T2SS
named
Yts1
,
which
has
been
found
to
be
important
for
virulence
in
mice
[
90
]
.

Ymt
is
essential
for
flea
colonization
by
Y
.
pestis
and
is
regulated
by
AHL
both
in
Y
.
pestis
[
95
]
and
P
.
luminescens
(
R
.
Heermann
,
unpublished
data
)
,
indicating
that
Ymt
is
also
required
for
insect
colonization
by
P
.
luminescens
.

We
also
identified
two
proteases
in
each
pathogen
(
Plu4291
,
Plu0631
,
YE0320
,
and
YE2087
)
without
a
homologue
in
the
other
bacterium
.

Propanediol
degradation
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
might
also
be
supported
by
YE4187
with
a
putative
GlcG
domain
which
is
predicted
to
be
involved
in
glycolate
and
propanediol
utilization
.

The
uhpABC
operon
as
well
as
mgtC
encoding
the
Mg2
+
transport
ATPase
subunit
have
been
found
to
be
induced
at
low
temperature
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
[
67
]
,
indicating
a
relevance
for
these
metabolic
genes
for
P
.
luminescens
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
during
insect
infection
.

Bacteria
use
two
different
strategies
to
acquire
sufficient
amounts
of
iron
,
namely
the
expression
and
secretion
of
high
-
affinity
iron
-
binding
compounds
called
siderophores
,
and
the
production
of
receptors
for
iron
carriers
such
as
heme
.

Interestingly
,
three
gene
loci
involved
in
iron
acquisition
,
namely
the
genes
encoding
the
hemin
storage
system
,
the
yersiniabactin
and
the
enterobactin
transporter
FepG
,
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
up
-
regulated
upon
temperature
decrease
in
Y
.
pestis
or
Y
.
ruckeri
,
respectively
(
Table
1
)
.

It
also
indicates
that
iron
acquisition
is
a
prerequisite
for
the
infection
process
of
pathogenic
bacteria
not
only
in
mammalian
,
but
also
in
invertebrate
hosts
,
and
underlines
the
suggestion
that
genetic
determinants
of
invertebrate
pathogens
such
as
P
.
luminescens
include
the
progenitors
of
virulence
factors
against
vertebrates
[
79
,
106
]
.

The
TctE
/
TctD
system
is
the
only
TCS
of
P
.
luminescens
without
homologue
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
(
see
section
"
Two
-
component
signal
transduction
"
,
Fig
.
2
)
.

This
pathogen
is
non
-
motile
at
body
temperature
,
and
a
connection
between
motility
and
virulence
is
well
-
documented
[
116
,
117
]
.

Evolution
of
pathogenicity

Certainly
,
the
question
whether
fundamental
differences
in
regulatory
networks
reflect
how
each
of
these
two
bacteria
specifically
interacts
with
either
the
insect
or
the
human
host
remains
to
be
addressed
in
more
detail
.

Moreover
,
P
.
luminescens
is
pathogenic
to
a
variety
of
insect
larvae
,
and
a
dose
of
<
5
colony
-
forming
units
directly
injected
into
the
blood
system
is
sufficient
to
kill
within
48
-
72
h
[
124
]
.

Summarizing
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
P
.
luminescens
have
evolved
partially
different
and
partially
similar
and
therefore
probably
conserved
mechanisms
to
detect
and
to
react
on
the
insect
host
.

The
GraRS
regulatory
system
controls
Staphylococcus
aureus
susceptibility
to
antimicrobial
host
defenses

In
a
S
.
aureus
SA113
graRS
deletion
mutant
,
the
content
of
D
-
alanine
in
teichoic
acids
was
reduced
by
47
%
and
the
mutant
showed
reduced
resistance
to
various
antibiotics
including
polymyxin
B
,
gallidermin
,
and
vancomycin
[
10
,

]
.

The
characteristic
of
invasive
GAS
infections
has
been
thought
to
attribute
to
genetic
changes
in
bacteria
,
however
,
no
clear
evidence
has
shown
due
to
lack
of
an
intriguingly
study
using
serotype
-
matched
isolates
from
clinical
severe
invasive
GAS
infections
.

It
causes
a
wide
variety
of
infections
ranging
from
uncomplicated
pharyngitis
and
skin
infections
to
severe
and
even
life
-
threatening
manifestations
,
such
as
necrotizing
fasciitis
(
NF
)
and
streptococcal
toxic
shock
-
like
syndrome
(
STSS
)
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
,
with
high
mortality
rates
ranging
from
20
%
to
60
%
[
3
]
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
explore
the
crucial
factors
in
the
pathogenesis
of
severe
invasive
GAS
infections
in
the
context
of
PMN
-
GAS
relationship
,
using
a
panel
of
emm49
clinical
isolates
from
patients
with
or
without
severe
invasive
infection
,
and
their
gene
-
manipulated
mutants
.

GAS
isolates
from
mice
with
severe
invasive
disease
had
mutations
in
csrS
,
raising
the
notion
that
CsrR
/
S
function
is
important
in
modulating
gene
expression
during
infection
.

However
,
as
shown
in
Figure
5B
,
the
csrS
genes
of
all
clinically
isolated
severe
invasive
GAS
had
a
deletion
,
a
point
mutation
,
or
an
insertion
,
thereby
,
resulting
in
the
creation
of
translational
stop
codons
(
NIH147
,
NIH226
,
NIH230
,
and
NIH269
)
or
in
a
mutation
in
the
presumed
kinase
domain
(
NIH200
)
.

As
shown
in
Figure
7A
,
the
NIH230
strain
caused
bacteremia
in
mice
24
h
after
intraperitoneal
injection
whereas
the
bacteremia
was
barely
detected
in
mice
infected
with
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
as
well
as
the
1566
strain
(
p
=
0
.
005
compared
with
non
-
invasive
isolates
,
and
p
=
0
.
005
compared
with
invasive
isolates
+
CsrS
)
.

Contrarily
,
no
significant
pathological
alterations
were
observed
in
the
mice
injected
with
the
1566
and
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
strains
(
Figure
7B
and
7C
)
.

Finally
,
we
assessed
the
influence
of
enhanced
expression
of
the
scpC
or
the
slo
gene
on
the
virulence
in
a
mouse
model
.

However
,
the
severe
invasive
isolates
analyzed
in
this
study
accumulated
mutations
in
the
csrS
gene
but
not
in
the
csrR
gene
(
Figure
5B
and
data
not

This
dominant
role
of
CsrS
is
the
first
important
observation
in
this
study
,
and
its
mutation
is
possibly
more
important
than
that
of
csrR
in
terms
of
etiopathogenesis
of
human
severe
invasive
diseases
.

Furthermore
,
DNA

induced
expression
of
this
operon
resulted
in
up
to
2560

fold
increased
resistance
to
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
and

increased
resistance
to
aminoglycosides
,
but
had
no
effect
on
beta

and

.

Alginate
production
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
phagocytic
killing
of
Pseudomonas
,
to
protect
from
antibiotic
exposure
[

]
,
[

]
,
and
is
associated
with
poor
prognosis
for
the
infected
patients
[
15
]
,
[

]
.

The
direct
observation
of
P
.
aeruginosa
microcolonies
encased
in
an
alginate
matrix
in
microscopy
studies
of
CF
bronchial
samples
[
17
]
,
along
with
a
large
body
of
additional
in

and
in
vivo
data
[

]
,
[
18
]
-
[
21
]
suggests
that
P
.
aeruginosa
forms
biofilms
in
the
lungs
of
CF
patients
.

Although
the
basis
of
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
is
not
fully
understood
,
it
is
likely
that
multiple
mechanisms
operate
simultaneously
in
biofilms
to
contribute
to
antibiotic
resistance
.

These
include
,
but
are
not
limited
to
,
the
global
virulence
factor
regulator
GacA
,
mutation
of
which
results
in
a
10
-
fold
decrease
in
biofilm
formation
and
failure
to
form
microcolony
structures
[

]
.

Mutations
in
algR
,
a
response
regulator
protein
required
for
synthesis
of
alginate
,
which
is
a
major
component
of
the
matrix
of
biofilms
in
the
cystic
fibrosis
lung
[

]
results
in
a
P

aeruginosa
strain
that
has
decreased
type
IV
pili

motility
and
biofilm

[

.

Killing
was
dose
-
dependent
,
with
faster
killing
observed
as
the
DNA
concentration
increased
(
Fig

)
.

Extracellular
DNA
induces
cell
death
by
membrane
perturbation
and
cell
lysis

This
property
,
in
combination
with
the
fast
-
killing
observed
in
response
to
extracellular
DNA
led
us
to
hypothesize
that
addition
of
exogenous
DNA
resulted
in
the
loss
of
membrane
integrity
through
cation
chelation
,
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
observed
with
the
known
cation
chelator
EDTA
[
58
]
.

PI
staining
was
observed
in
cells
exposed
to
DNA
and
EDTA
,
confirming
that
this
treatment
was
lethal
(
Fig
2B
)
.

PI
staining
also
revealed
the
presence
of
long
strands
of
genomic
DNA
,
presumably
as
a
consequence
of
the
loss
of
membrane
integrity
,
cell
lysis
and
release
of
cytoplasmic
contents
,
including
DNA
(
Fig
2B
)
.

Degradation
of
these
strands
by
DNAse
treatment
of
lysed
cells
confirmed
that
these
fibres
were
composed
of
DNA
(
Fig
S1
)
.

DNA
has
cation
chelating
activity

The
observation
that
DNA
disrupted
the
integrity
of
the
cell
envelope
causing
cell
lysis
suggested
that
DNA
was
acting
as
a
cation
chelator
.

The
genes
PA3552
-
PA3559
are
co

regulated
under
low
Mg2
+
conditions
and
are
thought
to
be
organized
as
an
operon
[

.

The
presence
of
DNA
in
peg
-
cultivated
biofilms
(
Fig

)
,
grown
in
the
absence
of
exogenous
DNA
,
likely
contributes
to
the
increased
antibiotic
resistance
generally
observed
in
biofilms
(
Table

)
.

The
PA3553
mutant
also
displayed
decreased
DNA

resistance
to
aminoglycosides
compared
to
PAO1
.

In
S

typhimurium
,
PhoPQ
regulates
multiple
LPS
modifications
that
decrease
the
OM
permeability
to
membrane
cationic
dyes
,
bile
salts
and
antibiotics
,
including
gentamicin
[

]
.

We
report
here
that
DNA
-
induces
aminoglycoside
resistance
in
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
,
and
this
resistance
is
partially
dependent
on
the
LPS
modification
operon
PA3552
-
PA3559
.

While
previous
studies
have
shown
the
biofilm
matrix
to
function
as
a
diffusion
barrier
to
antibiotics
,
these
results
demonstrate
a
novel
function
of
the
biofilm
matrix
component
DNA
,
where
the
cation
chelating
properties
of
DNA
in
biofilms
induces
resistance
to
host
-
derived
or
therapeutic
antimicrobials
.

The
growth
curve
of
the
DeltavicK
mutant
in
THY
displays
a
longer

phase
and
smaller
slope
in
the
exponential
growth
phase
than
that
of
the
parent
strain
(
Fig

)
,
indicating
that
the
vicK
deletion
detrimentally
affects
S

.

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
percentages
of
PMNs
associated
with

and
DeltavicK
bacteria
at
both
time
points
and
in
both
horse
and
rabbit
blood
(

,
indicating
that
the
DeltavicK

retains
the
ability
of
S

to
resist
to
phagocytosis
by
PMNs
.

Seven
of
the

died
,
whereas
7

the

All
the

the

infected
with
the

died
(

These

indicate
that
the

of

infections
.

Six
of
the
7
mice
survived
the
reinfection
(

,
suggesting
that
the
DeltavicK

induces
immunity
against
S

.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
interplay
between
a
pathogen
and
its
host
from
a
systems
biology
standpoint
,
we
focused
on
these
14
genes
.

These
experiments
validated
the
regulatory
model
and
showed
that
the
response
regulator
SsrB
and
the
MarR
type
regulator
,
SlyA
,
are
the
terminal
regulators
in
a
cascade
that
integrates
multiple
signals
.

Gastrointestinal
infections
are
the
second
most
common
cause
of
childhood
mortality
in
the
developing
world
and
Typhoid
alone
(
caused
by
serovar
Typhi
)
is
estimated
to
result
in
500
,
000
deaths
per
year
[

.

During
the
course
of
systemic
infection
in
mice
,
bacteria
are
found
within
neutrophils
,
monocytes
,
dendritic
cells
,
and
B
and

but
are
not
found
extracellularly
until
the
last

Results

Salmonella
regulators
required
for
systemic
mouse
infection
Typhimurium
encodes
a
surfeit
of
regulators
(
more
than
330
based
on
annotation
cited
in
NCBI
)
presumably
because
it
can
survive
and
replicate
in
many
different
environments
,
cause
infection
in
diverse
hosts
,
and
can
use
multiple
carbon
sources
and
terminal
electron
acceptors
.

Based
on
this
preliminary
screen
we
chose
the
regulators
spvR
,
fruR
,

,
phoP
/

,
ssrA

for

and

;
a
complete
list
of

is
provided
in

.

The
CI
test
identified
30
(
out
of
83
)
regulator
mutants
that
were
attenuated
in
comparison
to
the
wild
type
control
(
see
Table

)
.

Our
results
closely
match
these
published
results
.

The
14
virulence
regulators
,
whose
absence
was
identified
by
attenuated
virulence
in

in
this
study
,
presumably
sense
specific
environmental
signals
within
the
host
and
respond
by
expressing
the
appropriate
complement
of
virulence
factors
.

Transcriptional
profiles
were
significantly
different
from
the
parent
for
known
virulence
factors
required
during
systemic
infection
,
but
only
if
cells
were
grown
in
acidic

.

All
in
all
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
normal
function
of
each
of
the
14
regulators
is
to
activate
transcription
of
virulence
factors
necessary
for
systemic
infection
but
only
under
specific
environmental
conditions
.

We
observed
that
the
results
determined
by
these
two
methods
matched
closely
(
Figure
S2
)
and
that
the
level
of
transcription
of
ssaG
was
highest
when
Salmonella
was
grown
in
minimal
acidic
media
.

Furthermore
,
Hfq
regulates
translation
of
more
than
20
%
of

explaining
why
a
mutation
in
this

a

The

many

The
diverse
growth
conditions
used
in
this
study
,
as
well
as
differences
between
isogenic
strains
containing
mutations
in
virulence
regulators
,
make
our
data
set
ideal
for
this
type
of
analysis

A
recent
study
with
E

shows
that
the
CLR
algorithm
was
the
most
accurate
in
computing
the
correct
network
for
experimentally
verified
regulatory
interactions
[

.

The
cluster
analysis
identified
92
genes
that
are
co

regulated
with
the
SPI

encoded
type

secretion
system
but
not
located
within
SPI

.

The
network
suggests
that
both
slyA
and
ssrA
/
ssrB
could
coordinate
regulation
of
SPI
-
2
and
other
virulence
factors
by
integrating
signals
from
multiple
regulators
as
was
tested
next
.

To
test
this
possibility
we
constructed
double
deletions
of
ssrAB

ompRenvZ
,
ssrAB
/
phoPQ
,
ssrAB
/
csrA
and
ssrAB

Because
the
bacteria
are
exclusively
intracellular
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
replication
in

could
be
a
surrogate
for
systemic

infection
.

There
are
other
regulators
required
for

including

whose

Mycobacterium

Rv2623
regulates
growth
in

An
rv2623
-
deletion
mutant
of
the
virulent
M
.
tuberculosis
Erdman
strain
was
generated
by
specialized
transduction
[
12
]
.

The
observation
that
Rv2623
modulates
mycobacterial
growth
in
vitro
prompted
us
to
examine
the
effect
of
this
USP
on
the
in

kinetics
of
M
.
tuberculosis
infection
.

Moreover
,
Deltarv2623
-
infected
guinea
pigs
were
moribund
at
60
days
post
-
infection
,
while
those
challenged
with
wildtype
Erdman
remained
relatively
healthy
,
providing
further
evidence
that
the
mutant
strain
is
hypervirulent
in
this
model
.

This
increase
in
lung
pathology
was
also
largely
reversed
in
animals
infected
with
the
complemented
Deltarv2623

:
:
Phsp60Rv2623
strain
(
Figure

and

)
.

In

with
the
survival
data
,
quantification
of

revealed
a
growth
advantage
for
the
Rv2623

relative
to

As
in
the
guinea

studies
,
results

experiments
involving
the
reintroduction
of
a
single
copy
of
wildtype
rv2623
into
Deltarv2623
M
.
tuberculosis
reverses
the
hypervirulence
(
Figure
4C
)
exhibited
in
the
C3H
/
HeJ
model
,
thus
indicating
that
the
observed
growth
phenotype
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
deficient
for
the
universal
stress
protein
is
rv2623
-
specific
.

Therefore
,
the
hypervirulence
of
Deltarv2623
in
guinea
pigs
and
susceptible
mice
is
intriguing
;
if
Rv2623
provides
M
.
tuberculosis
protection
against
stress
,
it
might
be
expected
that
the
Rv2623

deficient
mutant
would
be
attenuated
in

.

An

is
capable
of

pathways
will
likely
illuminate
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
tubercle
bacillus
establishes
persistence
.

This
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
transition
to
later
stages
of
biofilm
formation
,
which
coincide
with
distinct
phenotypes
compared
to
planktonic
and
initial
attached
bacterial
cells
,
also
involves
sensing
of
environmental
signal
(
s
)
and
requires
the
coordinated
transduction
of
phosphorylation
events
(
phosphorelays
)
.

These
systems
together
form
a
coordinated
signaling
network
that
regulates
three
committed
steps
of
the
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
life
cycle
,
in
particular
the
transition
to
three
later
biofilm
developmental
stages
following
initial
attachment
,
namely
initiation
of
biofilm
formation
(
BfiRS
)
,
biofilm
maturation
(
BfmRS
)
,
and
microcolony
formation
(
MifRS
)
.

The
quantitative
mass
spectrometric
approach
by
LC
-
MS
/
MS
allowed
for
the
simultaneous
determination
of
peptide
amino
acid
sequences
by
collision
-
induced
dissociation
(
CID
)
in
the
MS
/
MS
mode
.

The
probable
TCS
regulatory
protein
PA5511
(
MifR
)
was
phosphorylated
following
72
hr
of
surface
-
associated
growth
.

This
may
be
due
to
detection
limitation
(
low
protein
concentrations
,
poor
protein
solubility
,
poor
ionization
)
and
/
or
limitation
in
the
number
of
phosphorylated
proteins
identified
(
see
Suppl
.
Tables
S1
and
S2
for
comparison
)
.

We
reasoned
that
if
protein
phosphorylation
occurs
in
sequence
,
inactivation
of
one
of
the
proteins
would
potentially
prevent
phosphorylation
of
the
other
proteins
of
the
phosphorelay
.

DeltagacS
biofilm
phosphorylation
patterns
showed
an
intermediate
phosphorylation
phenotype
with
PA4197
being
phosphorylated
but
PA4101
phosphorylation
lacking
(
not
shown
)
.

As
differential
and
sequential
phosphorylation
of
regulatory
proteins
was
detected
over
the
course
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
,
we
asked
whether
inactivation
of
these
regulatory
proteins
would
alter
or
affect
the
stage
-
specific
progression
of
biofilm
formation
.

Furthermore
,
the
mutant
biofilms
differed
significantly
from
wild
type
biofilms
with
respect
to
biomass
,
surface
coverage
,
and
roughness
coefficient
.

Complementation
restored
biofilm
formation
to
wild
type
levels
(
Fig
.
2C
,
Table
2
)
.

Under
the
conditions
tested
,
the
biofilm
architecture
of
all
three
mutants
was
similar
to
the
biofilm
architecture
shown
in
Fig
.

These
findings
implied
that
the
novel
regulatory
proteins
were
involved
in
the
regulation
of
biofilm
formation
at
later
stages
following
initial
attachment
.

In
this
study
we
describe
the
identification
and
initial
characterization
of
three
novel
two
-
component
systems
(
TCS
)
essential
in
regulating
three
committed
steps
in
biofilm
development
.

The
sequential
phosphorylation
of
sensors
/
regulatory
proteins
is
reminiscent
of
a
regulatory
cascade
in
which
each
phosphorylation
event
acts
as
a
trigger
for
bacterial
biofilm
cells
to
transition
to
the
next
developmental
stage
(
Fig
.

)
.

In

to
maintaining

of

[

,
T3SS

have
an
emerging
role
as

interactions
with

Results

The

which

(

.

The
level
of
attenuation
of
the

mutant
was
generally
higher
than
most
single

[

]
,
which
suggested
to
us
that
SrcA
contributes
to
an
important
aspect
of
T3SS

in

.

Although
the

the

differ

Introduction

In
common
with
many
other
bacteria
,
ECM
synthesis
in
Y
.
pestis
is
controlled
by
intracellular
levels
of
cyclic
di
-
GMP
,
which
are
determined
by
competing
activities
of
the
hmsT
diguanylate
cyclase
and
hmsP
phosphodiesterase
gene
products
[
8
]
,
[
9
]
.

In
this
study
,
we
characterized
the
Y
.
pestis
transcriptome
in
blocked
Xenopsylla
cheopis
rat
fleas
,
an
important
vector
of
plague
to
humans
.

This
provides
the
"
medium
"
for
Y
.
pestis
growth
,
but
these
and
other
factors
such
as
pH
,
oxygen
tension
,
osmolarity
,
and
flea
antibacterial
immune
components
are
poorly
defined
.

Blockage
occurred
between
1
.
5
and
3
.
5
weeks
after
the
initial
infectious
blood
meal
,
during
which
time
the
fleas
fed
on
uninfected
mice
twice
weekly
.

Profiles
of
the
exponential
and
stationary
phase
planktonic
cultures
clustered
most
closely
,
whereas
the
profiles
from
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
biofilm
growth
were
more
distinct
from
each
other
and
from
the
planktonic
culture
profiles
.

Certain
genes
whose
mutational
loss
resulted
in
an
altered
biofilm
phenotype
have
been
identified
in
these
studies
;
but
in
general
a
consistent
,
distinct
biofilm
gene
expression
profile
has
not
emerged
.

In
addition
to
the
known
temperature
-
induced
virulence
factors
,
iron
acquisition
systems
,
including
the
ybt
and
yfe
operons
that
are
required
for
virulence
;
and
oxidative
and
nitrosative
stress
response
genes
,
including
the
hmp
virulence
factor
,
are
highly
upregulated
in
the
rat
bubo
,
but
not
the
flea
.

The
psa
locus
is
regulated
by
RovA
[
36
]
.

Consistent
with
these
findings
,
rovA
expression
was
downregulated
in
the
flea
;
whereas
expression
of
rovM
,
a
negative
regulator
of
rovA
[
37
]
,
was
upregulated
.

The
transcriptional
regulator
gene
phoP
of
the
PhoPQ
two
-
component
regulatory
system
and
the
PhoP
-
regulated
mgtC
gene
were
expressed
at
levels
>
2
-
fold
higher
in
fleas
than
in
any
other
condition
(
Tables
1
,
S1
,
S3
)
.

However
,
deletion
of
yitR
or
yitA
-
yipB
(
y0183
-
y0191
)
does
not
affect
the
ability
of
Y
.
pestis
KIM6
+
to
infect
or
block
fleas
(
data
not
shown
)
.

To
determine
if
the
insecticidal
-
like
toxins
were
involved
in
resistance
to
phagocytosis
,
we
repeated
the
macrophage
experiments
with
a
Y
.
pestis
DeltayitR
mutant
,
which
as
expected
showed
greatly
reduced
expression
of
the
yit
and
yip
genes
in
vitro
and
in
the
flea
(
Fig
.
4B
)
.

However
,
it
was
not
possible
to
detect
any
relatively
minor
difference
in
LD50
because
the
number
of
bacteria
transmitted
by
a
blocked
flea
varies
widely
[
1
]
,
[
52
]
.

Coming
from
the
flea
,
Y
.
pestis
is
also
associated
with
the
biofilm
ECM
,
identical
or
closely
related
to
the
poly
-
beta
-
1
,
6
-
N
-
acetyl
glucosamine
ECM
of
staphylococcal
biofilms
,
which
has
been
shown
to
provide
protection
from
innate
immune
components
[
55
]
,
[
56
]
.

Methodology
/
Principal
Findings
A
total
of
127
differentially
expressed
genes
were
found
:
83
were
over
expressed
and
44
were
less
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
were
affected
,
including
VjbR
,
ExoR
and
OmpR
that
were
less
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

Conclusions
/
Significance
All
these
data
corroborate
the
impact
of
BvrR
/
BvrS
on
cell
envelope
modulation
,
confirm
that
this
system
controls
the
carbon
and
nitrogen
metabolism
,
and
suggest
a
cross
-
talk
among
some
regulators
to
adjust
the
Brucella
physiology
to
the
shift
expected
to
occur
during
the
transit
from
the
extracellular
to
the
intracellular
niche
.

Introduction

For
this
,
the
bacterium
must
coordinate
an
intricate
network
of
factors
to
generate
a
suitable
adaptive
response
to
the
various
signals
.

BvrR
/
bvrS
mutants
are
avirulent
in
mice
,
have
increased
susceptibility
to
killing
by
nonimmune
serum
,
show
reduced
invasiveness
to
epithelial
cells
and
macrophages
,
and
are
incapable
of
inhibiting
lysosome
fusion
and
of
intracellular
replication
[
4
]
.

This
evidence
suggests
an
altered
outer
membrane
structure
.

B
.
abortus
RNA
was
obtained
from
three
independent
cultures
of
each
wild
type
and
bvrR
mutant
cells
grown
in
the
same
conditions
.

The
statistical
analysis
resulted
in
the
identification
of
a
total
of
127
genes
differentially
transcribed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
versus
the
wild
type
.

On
the
other
hand
,
exoR
(
BAB1
_
0891
)
,
omp25a
(
BAB1
_
0722
)
,
hpr
-
K
(
BAB1
_
2094
)
,
bvrS
(
BAB1
_
2093
)
and
the
lipoproteins
(
BAB1
_
2147
,
BAB1
_
0589
,
BAB1
_
0358
)
were
among
the
less
expressed
genes
(
Table
1
)
.

Interestingly
,
all
genes
related
with
carbohydrate
,
amino
or
fatty
acids
metabolism
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

The
nitrite
reductase
gene
(
nirK
,
BAB2
_
0943
)
was
down
regulated
and
the
nitric
oxide
and
nitrous
oxide
reductases
genes
(
nor
C
,
BAB2
_
0955
;
nosZ
,
BAB2
_
0928
)
were
up
regulated
.

Brucella
may
also
take
advantage
of
denitrification
to
cope
with
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
production
in
the
macrophage
during
the
innate
response
against
infection
.

In
most
of
these
loci
,
upstream
of
the
regulatory
gene
the
pckA
is
divergently
expressed
(
Figure
2
)
.

[
15
]
have
suggested
that
in
Brucella
the
PTS
could
interact
with
the
BvrS
sensor
kinase
,
which
in
turn
phosphorylates
the
response
regulator
.

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
genes
were
also
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
compared
to
parental
strain
:
BAB1
_
0237
,
BAB1
_
0891
(
exoR
)
,
BAB1
_
1397
,
BAB2
_
0118
(
vjbR
)
,
BAB2
_
0762
(
ompR
)
,
BAB2
_
1127
and
BAB2
_
1152
.

Three
of
these
,
namely
exoR
,
ompR
and
vjbR
are
down
regulated
and
have
been
previously
implicated
in
Brucella
virulence
.

Most
of
the
genes
candidate
to
be
regulated
by
BvrR
/
BvrS
identified
in
our
microarray
experiments
can
be
involved
with
the
changes
needed
for
intracellular
survival
of
Brucella
.

SeMac
was
characterized
to
determine
whether
SeMac
has
IgG
endopeptidase
activity
and
inhibits
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

The
immunity
is
primarily
mediated
by
protective
antibodies
[
4
]
,
which
opsonize
and
thus
enhance
phagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

The
type
-
1
Mac
,
such
as
M1
Mac
produced
by
serotype
M1
GAS
strains
,
has
high
enzymatic
activity
and
low
affinity
to
Fc
receptor
on
the
surface
of
PMNs
,
while
the
type
-
2
Mac
can
bind
to
the
Fc
receptor
and
has
lower
enzymatic
activity
[
9
]
.

All
the
strains
tested
had
the
mac
gene
(
Fig
.
2
)
.

To
assess
the
in
vitro
production
of
SeMac
,
culture
supernatant
of
the
10
S
.
equi
strains
was
prepared
by
the
method
of
Lei
et
al
.

No
SeMac
was
detected
in
all
the
samples
(
data
not
shown
)
,
suggesting
that
SeMac
is
not
produced
in
vitro
.

SeMac
efficiently
cleaves
the
heavy
chain
of
human
IgG
.

Cleavable
horse
IgG1
has
PELLGG
,
while
the
non
-
cleavable
horse
IgG4
has
PECLSVG
in
the
same
region
,
suggesting
that
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
lower
hinge
region
are
important
for
cleavability
by
SeMac
and
GAS
Mac
.

Timoney
et
al
.
recently
reported
that
IdeE
/
SeMac
reduces
the
bactericidal
activity
of
isolated
equine
PMNs
for
S
.
equi
[
19
]
.

The
mac
gene
is
controlled
by
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
CovRS
[
5
]
,
which
also
controls
the
expression
of
many
virulence
factors
including
the
hyaluronic
capsule
[
20
]
.

The
fact
that
SeMac
does
not
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
indicates
that
SeMac
is
not
involved
in
the
evasion
of
the
acquired
horse
immunity
against
S
.
equi
.

This
suggests
that
SeMac
has
other
unknown
function
.
Here
we
report
that
this
activation
requires
both
PmrA
'
s
cognate
sensor

PmrB
,
which
had
been
previously
shown
to
respond
to
Fe3

and

,
and
PmrA

The

.

We
determined
that
the
regulatory
protein
PmrA
is
required
for
the
transcriptional
activation
in
response
to
mild
acid
pH
because
there
was
no
induction
of
the
three
investigated
genes
in
a
pmrA
mutant
(
Fig
.
2A
-
C
)
.

The
PmrB
protein
is
necessary
for
activation
of
the
PmrA
protein
in
low
Mg2
+
(
Kox
et
al
.
,
2000
;
Kato
and
Groisman
,
2004
)
and
in
the
presence
of
Fe3
+
(
Wosten
et
al
.
,
2000
)
,
consistent
with
the
notion
that
PmrB
is
the
major
phosphodonor
for
PmrA
.

Thus
,
we
determined
the
beta
-
galactosidase
activity
of
isogenic
pmrB
strains
harbouring
a
chromosomal
pbgP
-
lac
transcriptional
fusion
:
expression
was
approximately
sixfold
lower
in
a
pmrB
mutant
than
in
the
pmrB
+
strain
following
growth
at
pH
5
.
8
(
Fig
.
3
)
,
indicating
that
a
functional
pmrB
gene
is
necessary
for
a
normal
response
to
mild
acid
pH
.

In
agreement
with
the
gene
transcription
data
,
Western
blot
analysis
of
crude
extracts
using
anti
-
PmrD
antibodies
showed
that
the
PmrD
protein
was
produced
in
cells
grown
in
N
-
minimal
medium
pH
5
.
8
and
10
mM
MgCl2
but
not
in
cells
grown
in
the
same
medium
buffered
at
pH
7
.
7
(
Fig
.
4B
)
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
constructed
a
plasmid
that
produced
a
PmrB
protein
containing
a
single
histidine
to
alanine
substitution
at
position
35
.

However
,
the
substitution
of
this
residue
by
alanine
had
no
effect
on
the
response
to
mild
acid
pH
(
Fig
.
6B
)
.

Although
the
pKa
of
free
glutamic
acid
is
approximately4
,
which
is
well
below
the
range
of
pH
at
which
PmrA
-
activated
genes
are
induced
,
the
folding
of
a
protein
can
dramatically
change
the
pKa
of
its
residues
.

For
instance
,
the
pKa
of
one
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
of
the
regulatory
protein
TraM
is
approximately7
.
7
(
Lu
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

The
requirement
of
periplasmic
PmrB
residues
in
the
mild
acid
pH
activation
of
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
suggests
that
this
signalling
pathway
responds
to
changes
in
extracytoplasmic
pH
.

Indeed
,
the
pKa
of
one
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
of
the
regulatory
protein
TraM
is
approximately7
.
7
in
the
folded
protein
(
Lu
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

Therefore
,
it
is
plausible
that
protonation
/
deprotonation
of
one
or
more
of
the
glutamic
acids
in
the
periplasmic
domain
of
PmrB
could
occur
at
pH
approximately5
.
8
.

Similarly
,
cadC
mutants
have
been
isolated
that
are
impaired
in
the
ability
to
sense
only
one
of
its
two
inducing
signals
(
Dell
et
al
.
,
1994
)
.

Mlc
regulation
of
Salmonella
pathogenicity
island
I
gene
expression
via
hilE
repression

A
Salmonella
enterica
serovar
Typhimurium
mlc
mutant
showed
reduced
levels
of
invasion
and
cytotoxicity
compared
to
the
wild
-
type
,
and
exhibited
reduced
expression
levels
of
hilD
,
hilA
and
invF
,
which
are
regulatory
genes
in
the
Salmonella
pathogenicity
island
1
(
SPI1
)
.

Several
other
genes
have
been
identified
that
exert
positive
or
negative
effects
on
these
direct
regulators
of
SPI1
in
response
to
the
changes
in
environmental
conditions
.

RESULTS

Mutation
of
the
mlc
gene
reduces
Salmonella
invasiveness
The
process
of
invasion
into
non
-
phagocytic
epithelial
cells
,
which
is
known
to
be
mediated
by
proteins
secreted
by
the
SPI1
-
encoded
type
III
machinery
(
3
)
,
is
an
important
initial
step
in
the
pathogenesis
of
S
.

S
.

To
study
the
effect
of
Mlc
on
hilE
expression
,
we
measured
the
expression
of
hilE
-
lacZY
on
the
low
-
copy
plasmid
pMAB69
,
which
contains
the
hilE
promoter
region
from
-
886
to
+
121
,
relative
to
the
translation
start
site
.

When
these
cells
were
grown
in
static
cultures
to
exponential
phase
,
SL1344
-
pMAB69
expressed
28
.
9
+
/
-
3
.
5
Miller
units
of
beta
-
galactosidase
,
whereas
SR1304
-
pMAB69
expressed
49
.
5
+
/
-
5
.
3
Miller
units
of
beta
-
galactosidase
;
the
level
of
hilE
expression
in
the
mlc
mutant
was
almost
1
.
8
-
fold
higher
than
that
in
the
wild
-
type
strain
.

The
requirement
of
hilE
for
Mlc
function
was
reflected
in
the
levels
of
hilD
transcription
.

Additionally
,
the
over
-
expression
of
HilD
from
the
plasmid
pJB3
containing
hilD
gene
under
the
control
of
a
lac
promoter
caused
the
induction
of
hilA
by
approximately2
-
fold
and
invF
by
approximately6
-
fold
irrespective
of
hilE
or
mlc
mutation
when
real
-
time
PCR
was
used
to
compare
the
expression
levels
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Since
HilD
activates
the
transcription
of
hilA
(
14
)
,
which
in
turn
can
activate
HilA
-
dependent
invFA
expression
(
10
)
,
and
directly
activates
HilC
/
D
-
dependent
invFD
expression
(
16
)
,
these
results
establish
that
the
mlc
mutation
exerts
a
negative
effect
on
SPI1
gene
expression
,
mainly
by
increasing
the
level
of
hilE
expression
.

Baxter
and
Jones
(
18
)
have
identified
two
independent
hilE
promoters
,
P1
and
P2
.

The
addition
of
cold
probe
released
the
labeled
probe
from
the
retarded
complex
(
Figure
5A
,
right
panel
)
,
which
indicates
specific
binding
of
Mlc
to
the
hilE
P3
promoter
DNA
.

Interestingly
,
arabinose
also
activated
hilE
,
albeit
to
a
lesser
degree
than
either
glucose
or
mannose
.

These
results
imply
that
multiple
regulatory
pathways
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
hilE
and
hilD
by
carbohydrates
.

It
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
region
190
-
270
-
bp
upstream
of
the
hilE
promoter
is
required
for
the
activation
of
hilE
P2
expression
by
FimYZ
,
which
is
a
response
regulator
that
is
involved
in
the
expression
of
type
1
fimbriae
and
motility
genes
(
18
,
Figure
5C
)
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
glucose
plays
a
negative
role
in
the
expression
of
invasion
-
associated
genes
in
Salmonella
.

In
addition
,
hilE
expression
was
also
increased
in
the
presence
of
arabinose
,
which
suggests
an
additional
regulatory
mechanism
mediated
by
arabinose
.

However
,
even
in
the
absence
of
PhoR
,
many
carbon
sources
are
known
to
activate
the
Pho
regulon
via
CreC
,
which
is
a
PhoR
homolog
(
47
)
.

As
a
subgroup
of
genomic
islands
(
GIs
)
,
PAI
usually
contains
some
distinct
genetic
elements
acquired
by
horizontal
gene
transfer
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
.

In
pathogens
,
various
members
of
TCSTSs
have
been
shown
to
play
critical
roles
in
both
metabolism
and
pathogenesis
[
12
]
-
[

]
.

salK
encodes
a
396
aa
long
protein
,
with
five
N

terminal
transmembrane
domains
and
a
transmitter
domain
signature
motif
in
the
C

-
typical
of
sensor

kinases
of
TCSTSs
[

]
.

05SSU0945
,
situated
upstream
(
729
bp
long
intergenic
region
)
of
the
salKR
locus
,
encodes
a
94
aa
polypeptide
for
which
there
were
no
significant
database
matches
.

In
the
suspected
mutant
,
a
3
.
6
kb
restriction
fragment
hybridized
with
the
SpcR
probe
(
Fig
.
3B
,
lane
2
)
,
while
no
hybridization
signal
was
detected
when
the
internal
fragment
of
salKR
and
pUC18
served
as
the
probes
(
Fig
.
3C
and
3D
,
lane
2
)
.

First
,
the
ability
of
the
mutant
strain
to
retain
spectinomycin
resistance
was
assessed
.

As
shown
in
Figure
5
,
all
six
SPF
-
piglets
inoculated
intravenously
with
WT
developed
most
of
the
typical
disease
symptoms
,
including
high
fever
,
limping
,
swollen
joints
,
shivering
,
CNS
failure
and
respiratory
failure
within
24
hrs
.

For
identifying
genes
whose
expression
was
significantly
different
,
the
threshold
for
the
expression
ratio
between
the
mutant
and
wild
type
strain
was
set
at
2
.

Although
these
genes
were
found
to
be
down
-
regulated
in
the
mutant
,
it
is
not
understood
how
they
are
associated
with
the
attenuation
of
DeltasalKR
.

As
shown
in
Table
S1
,
the
quantitative
results
of
RT
-
PCR
were
highly
compatible
to
the
microarray
data
,
in
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
,
41
out
of
42
selected
genes
(
97
.
6
%
)
were
confirmed
to
have
similar
transcript
levels
using
these
two
different
techniques
,
thus
independently
confirming
the
microarray
results
.

Bioinformatics
analysis
revealed
that
the
GC
content
of
salKR
is
far
less
than
that
of
89K
island
and
the
whole
genome
,
implying
that
this
TCSTS
is
of
foreign
origin
which
may
have
been
acquired
through
horizontal
gene
transfer
.

It
has
been
well
documented
that
horizontal
gene
transfer
events
occur
frequently
in
pathogens
[
45
]
-
[
47
]
,
and
some
of
them
have
been
implicated
in
high
pathogenicity
[
48
]
and
even
in
the
causation
of
severe
diseases
[
49
]
.

However
,
in
our
study
,
neither
microarray
findings
nor
further
analysis
of
real
-
time
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
revealed
any
differences
in
level
of
transcription
of
the
known
virulence
factors
(
CPS
,
suilysin
,
MRP
and
EF
)
between
the
wild
type
and
mutant
strain
.

Mutants
lacking
the
gene
encoding
the
alternative
sigma
factor
sigmaE
(
rpoE
)
are
also
highly
attenuated
for
intracellular
survival
,
pointing
to
a
potential
connection
with
the
SsrAB
regulatory
system
.

Background

Deletion
of
rseA
in
Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis
causes
elevated
virulence
effector
synthesis
and
secretion
[
18
]
,
establishing
links
between
alternative
sigma

and

specific
regulators
.

By
testing
six
promoters
representing
four
classes
of
SsrB

(

and
(

)
an

)
we
demonstrate
that
RpoE
elicits
an
effect
on
a
subset
of
SsrB

regulated
genes
.

Deletion
of
rpoE
affects
a
subset
of
SsrB
-
regulated
virulence
genes
Salmonella
virulence
gene
expression
is
coordinated
in
vivo
and
may
be
regulated
,
in
part
,
by
alternative
sigma
factor
(
s
)
in
order
to
quickly
respond
to
the
host
environment
.

RpoE
is
involved
in
transcriptional
activity
of
a
subset
of
virulence
genes

We
predict
that
RpoE
confers
a
similar
fine
-
tuning
effect
on
Salmonella
virulence
gene
expression
that
is
required
for
optimal
within
-
host
fitness
during
infection
.

Also
necessary
are
protein
secretion
systems
[
4
]
and
toxins
required
for
cytotoxicity
and
survival
within
the
host
.

The
TB
strain
belongs
to
an
abundant
clonal
complex
in
the
P
.
aeruginosa
population
[

]
.

It
has
a
high
resistance
to
detergents
[
16
]
and
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
[
17
]
and
is
able
to
grow
within
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
[
18
]
.

We
screened
a
TB
STM
(
signature
tagged
mutagenesis
)
mutant
library
of
2
,
200
non
-
redundant
clones
[
19
]
,
[
20
]
and
selected
a
small
group
of
mutants
,
significantly
attenuated
for
virulence
in
C
.
elegans
.

Characterization
of
Selected
Attenuated
Mutants

Two
potential
regulatory
genes
were
found
.

We
recovered
two
additional
mutants
with
transposon
insertion
into
genes
which
have
functions
related
to
motility
.

The
adaptation
of
the
chemotaxis
system
in
response
to
changes
in
attractant
binding
is
dependent
on
the
methylation
state
of
the
MCPs
.

Another
interrupted
gene
,
PA2478
,
encodes
a
probable
thiol
:
disulfide
interchange
protein
of
the
DsbD
family
.

Characterization
of
the
cheB2
Mutant

The
reactions
were
performed
simultaneously
using
PA14
or
TB
genomic
DNA
as
matrix
.

The
swimming
or
swarming
motility
defect
is
,
however
,
much
more
severe
in
the
cheB1
mutant
as
compared
to
the
cheB2
mutant
.

Finally
,
we
used
a
chemotactic
assay
using
tryptone
as
chemo
-
attractant
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
.

The
liquid
killing
assay
by
contrast
,
is
read
after
overnight
feeding
of
the
nematodes
with
the
bacterial
strains
.

Interestingly
,
we
observed
that
a
mutation
in
the
cheB1
gene
yields
different
phenotypes
compared
to
the
cheB2
mutation
.

This
could
be
a
condition
to
set
the
function
of
the
Che2
proteins
and
allow
non
-
growing
cells
to
sense
and
respond
to
the
environment
in
a
different
manner
as
compared
to
fast
-
growing
cells
.

Inactivation
of
aprA
attenuated
both
the
capacity
to
persist
in
the
host
and
pathogenicity
.

Our
knowledge
of
the
Drosophila
immune
response
is
mainly
based
on
the
analysis
of
host
reactions
following
direct
injection
of
non
-
pathogenic
bacteria
into
the
insect
hemocoel
.

All
of
these
proteases
are
members
of
the
zinc
metzincin
family
of
Type
I
-
secreted
RTX
proteins
[
15
]
.

Injection
of
pure
AprA
into
the
hemocoel
rapidly
killed
adult
flies
,

this
protein
as
a

resulting
in
increased
expression
of
multiple
genes
,
including
one
encoding
for
a
metalloprotease
,
aprX
[
16
]
.

Studies
in
other
bacteria
have
shown
that
AprD
,
E
,
and
F
participate
in
the
elaboration
of
a
Type
I
transporter
required
for
AprA
secretion
to
the
external
medium
[
17
]
.

Using
the
same
assay
,
both
prtR
and
gacA
mutants
were
almost
avirulent
toward
Drosophila
indicating
that
both
genes
regulate
other
virulence
factors
in
addition
to
AprA
(

)
.

Use
of
Diptericin

strong

expression
in
the
proventriculus
,
an
organ
that
acts
as
a
valve
between
the
oesophagus
and
the
anterior
midgut
(
Figure

)
.

The
results
described
above
were
corroborated
by
the
over
-
expression
of
Imd
in
the
gut
or
in
the
fat
body
using
specific
Gal4
drivers
.

Thus
,
we
next
compared
survival
of
Rel
flies
specifically
expressing
a
wild

type
copy
of
Rel
in
the
intestine
using
caudal

cad
)

Gal4
.

In
these
flies
,
the
Imd
pathway
was
not
constitutively
active
in
the
gut
but
could
be
induced
upon
oral
bacterial
infection
similarly
to
the
wild
-
type
situation
(
Figure
S3A
)
.

Figure
5E
shows
that
Rel
flies
expressing
Rel
in
the
gut
survive
better
than
Rel
mutant
flies
.

AprA

against
Diptericin

We
have
shown
that
AprA
protects
P

response
.

To
investigate
a
possible
in

role
of
AprA
in
the
protection
against
AMPs
synthesized
in
the
gut
,
we
compared
survival
to
P

UAS
-
Gal4
system
(
referred

,

S3B
)
.

This
strategy
allowed
us
to
study
the
contribution
of
each
antibacterial
peptide
to
the
defense
against
a
P
.
entomophila
infection
.

Altogether
,
our
results
provide
an
in
vivo
demonstration
that
AprA
functions
in
the
protection
of
P
.
entomophila
against
Drosophila
AMPs
.

Previous
studies
revealed
only
a
modest
contribution
of
Diptericin
to
resistance
against
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
during
systemic
infection
[
22
]
.

This
can
be
compared
with
many
human
pathogens
for
which
activation
of
an
inflammatory
response
represents
a
part
of
their
invasive
strategy
[
25
]
.

However
,
in
most
cases
,
attempts
to
evaluate
the
role
of
metalloproteases
in
virulence
have
failed
to
obtain
conclusive
results
with
respect
to
a
specific
function
[
20
,
21
]
.

Many
pseudomonads
and
other
bacteria
express
proteases
similar
to
AprA
but
are
not
able
to
infect
Drosophila
by
oral
ingestion
.

This
indicates
that
AprA
is
not
the
sole
virulence
factor
required
for
persistence
in
the
Drosophila
gastrointestinal
tract
.

The
genome
of
P
.
entomophila
contains
several
genes
encoding
putative
insecticidal
toxins
(
e
.
g
.
,
Tc
toxins
,
hemolysins
,
and
lipopeptides
)
.

A
Comprehensive
Genetic
Characterization
of
Bacterial
Motility

This
allows
us
to
place
the
novel
genes
within
the
context
of
signaling
and
regulatory
networks
,
including
the
Rcs
phosphorelay
pathway
and
the
cyclic
di
-
GMP
second
-
messenger
system
.

A
major
challenge
of
the
post
-
genome
era
is
the
development
of
efficient
and
comprehensive
methods
for
revealing
the
genetic
basis
of
these
behaviors
across
diverse
clades
,
especially
as
the
emerging
field
of
metagenomics
begins
to
reveal
the
wide
assortment
of
microbial
life
on
the
planet
[
1
]
.

An
impressive
achievement
of
20th
-
century
biology
was
a
systems
-
level
understanding
of
bacterial
chemotaxis
in
terms
of
the
structures
,
interactions
,
and
organization
of
the
roughly
50
constituent
molecular
components
[
2
-
4
]
.

The
direction
of
rotation
is
influenced
by
the
output
of
the
chemotaxis
network
,
which
consists
of
a
signal
transduction
cascade
that
allows
robust
adaptation
to
local
concentrations
of
ligands
over
many
orders
of
magnitude
[
7
,
8
]
.

These
events
yield
an
orderly
"
just
-
in
-
time
"
expression
and
assembly
of
the
flagellar
components
[
11
]
,
which
consist
of
a
basal
body
complex
and
a
filament
.

For
these
reasons
,
flagellar
-
mediated
motility
is
an
ideal
test
case
for
any
modern
post
-
genomic
approach
that
attempts
to
efficiently
and
comprehensively
reveal
the
genetic
basis
of
a
complex
bacterial
phenotype
.

In
this
study
,
we
make
improvements
on
a
microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
strategy
[
12
]
,
increasing
its
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
revealing
the
contribution
of
each
and
every
gene
in
the
genome
to
a
phenotype
of
interest
.

In
each
of
our
experiments
,
a
population
of
mutants
is
challenged
for
competitive
growth
under
a
selection
of
interest
.

Once
inoculated
into
a
region
of
the
soft
agar
,
bacteria
deplete
local
nutrients
and
chemotax
radially
outward
following
the
concentration
gradient
of
preferred
substrates
[
17
]
.

Survival
of
a
mutant
meant
either
the
loss
of
its
flagella
,
the
loss
of
flagellar
CCW
rotation
,
or
the
loss
of
other
components
necessary
for
infection
.

Most
of
these
non
-
flagellar
genes
encode
components
of
the
cell
envelope
.

OPG
mutants
were
defective
in
both
swimming
and
swarming
;
surprisingly
,
however
,
only
mutants
with
large
LPS
truncations
showed
significant
defects
in
these
behaviors
(
Figures
3E
and
4
)
.

Therefore
,
while
rcsC
mutations
disrupt
the
RcsF
-
-
>
RcsC
-
-
>
RcsD
-
-
>
RcsB
phosphorelay
cascade
,
the
phosphorylation
of
RcsB
cannot
be
fully
reversed
in
the
absence
of
RcsC
phosphatase
activity
,
as
observed
by
the
reduced
flhDC
-
lacZ
expression
and
motility
exhibited
by
rcsC
and
rcsD
mutants
(
Figure
4
)
.

We
also
observed
that
sensitivity
to
chi
-
phage
was
higher
in
rfaI
mutants
than
rfaC
mutants
,
indicating
that
chi
-
phage
infectivity
is
directly
related
to
the
degree
of
flhDC
expression
(
Figures
4
,
5B
,
and
5C
)
.

A
sample
of
suppressor
mutants
extracted
from
the
extreme
edge
of
the
motile
front
was
used
for
both
microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
,
and
for
isolation
of
individual
mutants
for
subsequent
characterization
.

Among
the
18
suppressor
mutants
sampled
at
random
from
the
DeltayhjH
background
,
half
had
insertions
in
different
regions
of
ycgR
,
a
gene
encoding
a
protein
of
unknown
function
(
Figure
6D
)
.

Among
the
loci
that
partially
suppress
the
motility
defect
of
DeltayhjH
are
fliZ
(
a
gene
predicted
to
be
a
regulator
of
the
flagellum
-
specific
sigma
factor
sigma28
)
,
yfiR
(
a
gene
identified
in
the
selection
for
swarming
motility
defective
mutants
)
,
and
three
additional
genes
of
unknown
function
:
yjdA
,
yjcZ
,
and
yegE
.

YhjH
contains
an
EAL
domain
,
and
expression
of
this
protein
leads
to
the
degradation
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
and
enhanced
motility
in
S
.
enterica
[
52
]
.

We
argue
that
YfgF
has
an
active
EAL
domain
and
functions
as
a
PDE
based
on
three
observations
:
(
1
)
expression
of
this
gene
enhances
motility
of
the
DeltayhjH
strain
(
Figure
6E
)
;
(
2
)
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
YfgF
shows
similarity
to
enzymatically
active
EAL
domains
(
Figure
S10
)
;
and
(
3
)
the
amino
acid
sequence
lacks
a
complete
GGDEF
motif
needed
for
DGC
activity
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Such
an
interaction
may
explain
the
observed
rotational
bias
of
flagella
in
DeltayhjH
mutants
(
Figure
6B
)
and
is
in
agreement
with
our
finding
that
mutations
in
ycgR
strongly
suppress
the
motility
defects
of
DeltayhjH
mutants
(
Figure
6F
)
.

YfiR
is
predicted
to
be
a
periplasmic
protein
,
YfiB
shows
sequence
similarity
to
outer
-
membrane
porin
proteins
,
and
YfiN
is
a
predicted
inner
-
membrane
protein
with
GGDEF
and
HAMP
domains
.

According
to
this
model
,
the
transposon
insertion
library
should
harbor
mutants
that
perform
chemotaxis
in
high
[
NaCl
]
as
well
as
wild
-
type
cells
do
under
low
[
NaCl
]
conditions
.

A
non
-
piliated
mutant
produces
less
biofilm
than
the
parent
strain
and
is
attenuated
in
a
rat
model
of
endocarditis
[
18
]
and
in
a
murine
urinary
tract
infection
model
[
16
]
.

Surprisingly
,
the
genomes
align
syntenically
,
as
shown
in
Figure
2
,
despite
the
fact
that
25
%
of
the
V583
genome
is
composed
of
mobile
elements
.

However
,
most
of
the
differences
are
small
and
cannot
be
visualized
in
this
figure
.

Both
OG1RF
CRISPR
elements
are
composed
of
7
repeats
of
a
37
bp
palindromic
sequence
with
a
29
bp
spacer
.

The
repeat
upstream
of
cas
_
csn1
appears
to
have
degenerated
since
it
shares
only
23
bp
with
the
37
bp
repeat
cluster
downstream
of
the
last
gene
.

A
unique
feature
of
the
OG1RF
CRISPR1
locus
is
the
presence
of
a
gene
downstream
of
the
element
,
which
encodes
a
hypothetical
119
amino
acid
transmembrane
protein
.

Also
,
in
place
of
EF3153
,
EF3154
,
and
EF3155
(
which
share
70
%
similarity
among
themselves
)
,
were
found
non
-
distantly
related
homologues
,
OG1RF
_
0209
and
OG1RF
_
0210
,
which
share
60
-
80
%
similarity
with
EF3153
,
EF3154
,
and
EF3155
.

However
,
the
order
of
the
genes
is
not
the
same
between
E
.
faecalis
and
L
.
casei
.

Since
we
did
not
identify
any
remnants
of
the
iol
operon
in
V583
,
it
would
appear
that
at
least
two
independent
events
at
the
same
location
differentiate
OG1RF
and
V583
,
suggesting
that
it
is
a
hot
region
for
rearrangement
.

This
region
between
EF2239
and
EF2352
(
111
Kb
)
is
also
missing
in
the
Symbioflor
1
strain
(
referred
to
as
gap
2
)
[
5
]
.

The
possible
junction
and
presence
of
unique
sequence
in
this
region
,
if
investigated
,
was
not
mentioned
in
the
publication
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
region
contains
:
a
putative
adhesin
protein
gene
(
OG1RF
_
0039
)
at
one
end
of
the
fragment
;
homologues
of
14
Tn916
-
associated
genes
(
Tn916
_
2
to
Tn916
_
12
,
Tn916
_
18
and
Tn916
_
19
,
with
an
average
of
70
%
similarity
)
;
and
a
gene
encoding
a
putative
integrase
(
OG1RF
_
0088
)
at
the
other
end
-
these
three
features
are
also
present
in
Tn5386
in
E
.
faecium
D344R
[

]
.

An
uninterrupted
competence
operon
in
OG1RF

In
V583
,
the
fourth
gene
of
this
operon
(
corresponding
to
OG1RF
_
0148
)
is
interrupted
by
phage
4
(
EF1896
-
EF2043
)
;
in
addition
,
EF1984
contains
a
premature
stop
codon
not
found
in
the
corresponding
gene
in
OG1RF
(
OG1RF
_
0228
)
.

To
investigate
the
possibility
that
directly
or
indirectly
the
com
operon
might
be
responsible
for
this
phenotype
,
we
also
evaluated
transformability
by
electroporation
.

When
compared
with
OG1RF
,
transposon
mutants
[
12
]
in
the
OG1RF
equivalent
of
EF2045
(
encoding
the
comGB
homologue
)
and
in
the
OG1RF
equivalent
of
EF1986
(
encoding
the
comGF
homologue
)
showed
similar
levels
of
transformability
by
electroporation
(
data
not
shown
)
,
implying
that
the
difference
in
electroporation
efficiency
observed
between
OG1RF
and
V583
is
not
related
to
this
locus
.

Based
on
our
previous
microarray
data
,
the
Fsr
system
does
not
regulate
the
comY
operon
,
at
least
under
our
previously
used
conditions
(
mid
-
log
phase
growth
to
early
stationary
phase
in
brain
heart
infusion
(
BHI
)
)
[
22
]
.

The
acquisition
of
MGE
is
believed
to
be
an
important
mechanism
by
which
the
species
E
.
faecalis
had
been
able
to
generate
genetic
diversity
and
,
thereby
,
highly
variable
phenotypes
[
4
]
.

[
36
]
demonstrate
that
these
factors
may
be
present
in
harmless
strains
while
absent
in
clinical
isolates
,
indicating
that
E
.
faecalis
virulence
is
not
dependent
on
any
single
virulence
factor
.

The
inverse
allelic
exchange
was
also
performed
to
replace
the
intact
ropB
in
5448
with
the
mutated
allele
from
5628
.

While
the
M1T1
GAS
has
become
the
most
common
cause
of
streptococcal
pharyngitis
,
this
clone
is
also
overrepresented
in
cases
of
severe
invasive
disease
[
6
]
,
[
7
]
.

Studies
of
M1T1
clinical
isolates
from
invasive
disease
cases
have
revealed
an
inverse
relationship
between
expression
of
the
extracellular
cysteine
protease
SpeB
and
clinical
severity
[
8
]
.

SpeB
is
a
secreted
cysteine
protease
initially
expressed
as
40
kDa
zymogen
which
is
then
converted
to
the
28
kDa
active
form
by
autocatalytic
processing
[
10
]
.

This
analysis
begins
with
a
naturally
-
occuring
mutation
in
ropB
identified
in
one
such
strain
.

The
ropB
mutation
of
strain
5628
was
not
recapitulated
on
passage
in
the
mouse
subcutaneous
infection
model
.

SpeB
is
the
principal
target
of
RopB
regulation
in
vivo

Discussion

Restoration
of
full
-
length
RopB
in
5628R
+
resulted
in
gaining
SpeB
expression
,
but
did
not
result
in
changes
in
hemolysis
,
DNase
activity
or
resistance
to
killing
by
neutrophils
.

Microarray
analysis
was
conducted
using
in
vivo
-
derived
RNA
,
since
the
transcriptome
of
bacteria
grown
in
vitro
may
differ
greatly
from
the
transcriptome
found
during
the
course
of
infection
.

This
finding
supported
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
data
that
suggested
SpeB
is
the
main
target
of
RopB
regulation
in
this
strain
.

This
finding
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
inactivation
of
SpeB
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
initiate
invasive
disease
.

In
M1T1
GAS
,
an
intact
RopB
and
efficient
SpeB
production
are
necessary
for
systemic
infection
.

However
,
the
proteins
regulated
by
Hfq
and
SmpB
are
not
as
clearly
defined
.

In
this
report
we
have
used
global
proteomics
to
directly
identify
proteins
regulated
by
Hfq
or
SmpB
by
comparing
protein
abundance
in
the
parent
and
isogenic
hfq
or
smpB
mutant
.

These
proteins
represent
a
broad
spectrum
of
Salmonella
proteins
required
for
many
biological
processes
including
host
cell
invasion
,
motility
,
central
metabolism
,
LPS
biosynthesis
,
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
,
and
fatty
acid
metabolism
.

Post
-
transcriptional
regulation
of
gene
expression
by
small
noncoding
RNAs
(
sRNAs
)
is
widespread
in
both
prokaryotes
and
eukaryotes
and
has
only
recently
been
recognized
as
playing
a
prominent
role
in
the
regulation
of
cellular
processes
.

Its
broad
role
in
regulation
at
the
translational
level
has
recently
been
hinted
at
by
Sittka
and
co
-
workers
[
10
]
.

The
RNA
-
binding
protein
SmpB
specifically
interacts
with
the
sRNA
tmRNA
(
also
known
as
ssrA
and
10Sa
)
and
is
required
for
all
known
functions
of
tmRNA
[
11
]
.

Once
bound
,
tmRNA
adds
a
peptide
tag
to
the
nascent
partially
synthesized
protein
chain
which
targets
it
for
degradation
by
C
-
terminal
-
specific
cellular
proteases
[
15
]
,
[
16
]
,
[
17
]
,
[
18
]
.

In
this
method
[
28
]
,
the
coding
region
between
the
initiation
methionine
and
the
last
seven
amino
acids
of
the
gene
was
replaced
with
an
inframe
"
scar
"
sequence
that
does
not
contain
any
stop
codons
.

However
this
most
likely
is
an
underestimate
of
the
true
number
of
proteins
that
are
regulated
by
Hfq
,
if
accurate
protein
identifications
could
be
made
for
the
remaining
2829
orfs
of
the
entire
Salmonella
proteome
(
4450
orfs
)
that
are
either
expressed
at
levels
too
low
to
be
detected
or
not
expressed
under
the
four
growth
conditions
employed
in
this
study
.

Of
the
781
proteins
and
492
transcripts
regulated
by
Hfq
,
113
genes
overlapped
both
sets
.

While
the
role
of
Hfq
as
a
global
regulator
has
become
increasingly
appreciated
over
the
past
few
years
,
the
actual
extent
of
Hfq
regulation
of
translation
remains
unknown
.

We
observed
changes
in
expression
for
approximately50
%
of
the
observed
Salmonella
Typhimurium
proteome
based
on
an
ANOVA
analysis
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
(
Table
S1
)
.

One
hallmark
of
growth
under
nutrient
poor
conditions
is
lower
expression
of
the
machinery
necessary
to
synthesize
proteins
,
including
tRNA
synthetases
and
other
factors
.

This
suggests
that
Hfq
normally
represses
translation
of
these
genes
under
conditions
that
mimics
the
intracellular
environment
(
AMM
)
.

Hfq
was
observed
to
modulate
numerous
proteins
involved
in
envelope
stress
under
AMM
-

conditions
,
including
FkpA
,
SurA
,
HtrA
,

We
note
however
that
a

to
confirm
the

For

In

it

The

As

it

indicate
that
the

Results
and
discussion

During
the
course
of
our
experiments
,
we
were
able
to
collect
samples
from
three
different
animals
from
the
same
herd
,
before
antibiotherapy
was
undertaken
to
eradicate
the
infection
.

Clinical
signs
ranged
from
depression
to
respiratory
distress
,
while
macroscopic
observation
of
deceased
pigs
revealed
lobar
fibrinohemorrhagic
pleuropneumonia
,
along
with
necrotic
lesions
and
the
accumulation
of
bloody
fluid
in
the
thorax
.

Only
28
genes
were
identified
as
divergent
/
absent
in
our
field
strain
,
when
compared
to
the
reference
serotype
5b
L20
strain
(
Table

)
.

Out
of
these
28
genes
,
20
can
be
found
in
two
major
regions
of
the
genome
:
14
putative

for
phage
structures
,
while
6
are
located
in
the
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
tight

)
locus
.

Some
genes
might
also
be
present
in
the
genome
of
strain
896
-
07
and
absent
in
reference
strain
L20
,
and
therefore
absent
on
AppChip2
.

Our
results
indicated
that
A

pleuropneumoniae
could
easily
be
isolated
in
pure
culture
from
lung
tissues
of
all
animals
,
and
that
the
number
of
CFU
varied
from

to
1
x
107
per
gram
of

(

.

Both

and
APL

,
were
not
identified
as

during

We
also

our

to

With

to
their
possible

,
some
genes

Numerous

were
identified
as

.

Genes
from
the

operon
,
involved
in
the
uptake
and

of

[

,
were
up

:
the
genes
malP
,
malK
,
malF
,
malG
,
malQ
and
a
malM
homolog
(
APL
_

)
were
actively
transcribed
in
the
host
(
average

of

)
,
and
gene
lamB1
,
which
codes
for

,
showed
a

fold
change
in
the

(
iron

)
gene
codes
for
a

,
possibly

.

Interestingly
,
the
irp
gene
is
located
directly
next
to
APL
_
0920
,
a
conserved
lipoprotein
in
the
L20
genome
although
they
are
transcribed
in
opposite

.

These
three
genes
,
namely
fhaB

APL

)
,
irp
(

and

could
all
represent
excellent
candidates
for
the
development
of
a

against

pleuropneumoniae
.

While
our
results
can
help
decipher
some
of
the
adaptations
A

pleuropneumoniae
has
to
make
once
it
infects
the
host
,
much
more
research
is
necessary
in
order
to
understand
the
whole
picture
of
the
disease
.

These
data
provide
a
high
-
resolution
map
of
a
regulatory
network
and
the
underlying
logic
enabling
pathogen
adaptation
to
a
host
.

In
the
Salmonella
genus
,
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island
is
found
only
in
pathogenic
serotypes
of
Salmonella
enterica
that
infect
warm
-
blooded
animals
and
is
absent
from
Salmonella
bongori
,
which
colonizes
cold
-
blooded
animals
[
18
]
.

This
included
almost
all
genes
in
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island
as
well
as
effector
genes
encoded
throughout
the
genome
(
Dataset
S1
)
.

The
SsrA
-
SsrB
system
was
acquired
by
horizontal
gene
transfer
into
the
S
.
enterica
species
after
divergence
from
what
is
now
extant
S
.
bongori
.

We
also
determined
the
distribution
of
down
-
regulated
genes
among
genomic
islands
[
24
]
,
including
prophages
,
pathogenicity
islands
(
SPI
-
islands
)
and
additional
regions
of
difference
(
ROD
)
between
S
.
enterica
and
S
.
bongori
(
Dataset
S2
)
.

From
this
,
the
133
down
-
regulated
genes
mapped
to
86
operons
,
49
of
which
had
an
SsrB
interaction
upstream
or
within
the
first
gene
of
the
operon
(
Table
2
)
.

Next
,
we
examined
our
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
data
for
the
presence
of
a
conserved
regulatory
motif
.

Interestingly
,
two
copies
of
the
palindrome
occur
upstream
of
the
ssrA
-
ssrB
operon
in
S
.

The
presence
of
a
conserved
palindrome
sequence
in
SPI
-
2
promoters
and
in
related
sequences
from
the
endosymbiont
S
.
glossinidius
suggested
that
regulatory
input
by
SsrB
was
through
a
palindrome
sequence
architecture
.

However
,
the
orientation
of
individual
heptamers
was
essential
for
transcriptional
input
since
rewiring
the
palindrome
in
any
head
-
to
-
head
orientation
produced
negligible
promoter
activity
.

When
tested
in
promoter
activity
experiments
,
this
reporter
was
unable
to
activate
transcription
and
was
identical
to
the
X
-
X
-
X
mutant
construct
(
Figure
5D
)
.

To
examine
the
extent
to
which
regulatory
evolution
has
been
selective
for
this
genetic
architecture
,
we
created
a
position
weight
matrix
(
PWM
)
for
the
five
strongest
palindrome
sites
in
SPI
-
2
and
the
orthologous
sites
in
Sodalis
SSR
-
3
.

Remarkably
,
this
accounted
for
17
of
22

genome

encoded
effectors
translocated
by
the
SPI
-

exceptions
are

steA
,
gogB
,
and
sseK
,
and

encoded

and
spvC
)
.

Together
,
these
data
provide
compelling
evidence
for
the
identity
of
the
DNA
recognition
element
that
has
been
selected
through
evolution
to
co
-
regulate
an
SsrB
-
dependent
gene
program
involved
in
adaptation
to
a
host
.

This
regulatory
system
was
co
-
acquired
with
a
T3SS
encoded
in
the
SPI
-
2
pathogenicity
island
and
likely
contributed
to
immediate
and
gradual
phenotypic
diversity
as
new
regulatory
nodes
were
explored
and
acted
upon
by
natural
selection
.

The
SSR

glossinidius
is
fully
conserved
in
gene
synteny
and
content
with
that
of
SPI

[
31
]
,
with
the
exception
of
two
effector
genes
missing
in
SSR
-

(
sseF
and
sseG
)
that
are
required
to
localize
vacuolar
Salmonella
to
the
perinuclear
Golgi
in
host
cells
[
38
]
,
[
39
]
.

To
the
contrary
,
high
local
conservation
in
the
promoters
evolved
in
Salmonella
and
Sodalis
was
the
crux
in
defining
the
functional
SsrB
input
among
stochastic
noise
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
the
engagement
of
unique
regulatory
modules
in
niche
adaptation
,
implicate
a
critical
role
for
bacterial
genetic
heterogeneity
that
surpasses
transcriptional
in
vivo
adaptation
,
and
portray
the
dynamics
underlying
the
selection
of
hypervirulent
covS
mutants
over
their
parental
WT
cells
.

Despite
the
association
between
covS
mutations
and
the
emergence
of
the
hypervirulent
phenotype
of
M1T1
strains
,
it
is
unclear
whether
this
increased
virulence
can
be
entirely
attributed
to
the
modulation
of
the
CovR
regulon
or
if
other
networks
are
also
perturbed
in
vivo
directly
,
indirectly
,
or
independently
of
the
CovRS
system
.

Such
comprehensive
analyses
highlighted
the
behavior
of
genomic
subsystems
that
may
be
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
S

pyogenes

and
pathogenesis
.

This
difference
in
buoyancy
can
be
attributed
to
differences
in
proteolytic
activity
(
WT

>
AP
)
that
may
degrade
many
surface
proteins
,
including

,
or

,
but
none
attempted
to
capture
the
dynamic

in
the
bacterial

in

.

Overall
,
at
the

conservative
statistical
threshold
(

)
,
the
transcription
of

)
out
of
2
,
329
genes
probed
in
the
microarrays
was
significantly
perturbed
(
up
or
down
,
at
one
or
more
conditions
,

S3
)
and
the
only
set
of
contiguous
genes
that
underwent
transcriptional
changes
at
all
tested
conditions
is
the
SpeB
operon
gene
set
(
CC4

)
.

However
,
the
fold

change
in
SpeB

level
largely
varied
across
the
four
experimental

,
ranging
from
a

to
a

(

.

In
this
study
,
we
captured
dynamic
events
underlying
the
phenotypic
switch
resulting
from
this
population
restructuring
.

As
both
bacterial
variants
were
subjected
to
the
host
environment
,
they
underwent
additional
changes
in
gene
expression
.

Many
of
the
in

changes
that
both
the
WT
and
AP
bacteria
underwent
are
suggestive
of
major
metabolic
reprogramming
associated
with
the
transition
from
a
saprophytic
lifestyle
in
the
carbohydrate
-
rich
laboratory
culture
medium
to
a
parasitic
lifestyle
in
the
vascularized
and
the
anaerobic
subcutaneous
environments
rich
in
peptides
,
amino
acids
,
nucleotides
,
and
different
types
of
complex
carbohydrates
.

Among
the
upregulated
genes
are
dipepetide
and
sucrose
-
specific
transporters
,
whose
upregulation
supports
the
hypothesis
that
the
bacteria
are
switching
diets
[
39
]
and
attempting
to
scavenge
nutrients
available
in
their
new
host
environment
.

Both
these
expression
patterns
suggest
CovS
-
dependent
in
vivo
signaling
via
different
downstream
pathways
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
how
the
murine
model
has
allowed
us
to
finely
dissect
two
classes
of
events
affecting
GAS
sociomicrobiology
:
those
related
to
reversible
transcriptional
adaptation
and
those
irreversibly
caused
by
the
covS
mutation
in
AP
bacteria
.

Genes
in
neighbor
clusters
could
have
been
otherwise
overlooked
either
because
they
were
misannotated
but
their
co
-
occurrence
in
known
clusters
revealed
their
importance
,
or
because
they
did
not
pass
the
statistical
tests
but
,
since
many
bacterial
transcripts
are
polycistronic
,
the
expression
of
two
or
more
members
of
a
polycistron
strongly
suggests
that
the
whole
operon
is
expressed
.

In
fact
,
WT
bacteria
underwent
the
most
dramatic
in
vivo
transcriptional
reprogramming
(
Table
2
)
;
yet
,
they
failed
to
survive
since
after
five
to
seven
days
post
-
infection
,
they
became
extinct
,
and
only
AP
bacteria
could
be
isolated
from
the
mice
chambers
[
16
]
.

Streptococcus
agalactiae
(
group
B
streptococcus
)
is
an
important
cause
of
neonatal
invasive
infections
and
variety
of
diseases
in
human
and
animals
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
.

This
bacterium
is
able
to
sense
the
changing
environmental
conditions
and
colonize
numerous
tissues
employing
different
mechanisms
of
gene
regulation
.

Subsequently
,
phosphoryl
group
is
transferred
to
RR
protein
resulting
in
conformational
changes
in
RR
molecule
.

HK06
/
RR06
was
also
important
for
the
ability
of
pneumococci
to
adhere
to
epithelial
cells
in
vitro
and
to
survive
and
proliferate
in
an
in
vivo
mouse
model
[
22
]
.

The
strains
were
tested
by
PCR
for
the
presence
of
virulence
gene
bac
and
sak188
and
sak189
TCS
genes
,
which
were
previously
found
to
be
located
on
pathogenicity
island
[
13
]
.

In
this
strain
,
the
bac
gene
has
unique
allele
with
the
closest
similarity
with
676a
and
676b
alleles
according
to
classification
of
Kong
et
al
.

Briefly
,
DNA
fragments
of
sak188
and
sak189
genes
were
PCR
amplified
using
pairs
of
primers
hkFor
,
hkRev
,
and
rrFor
,
rrRev
(
Table
1
)
,
respectively
.

Construction
of
the
strains
was
confirmed
by
PCR
and
nucleotide
sequencing
(
data
not
shown
)
.

The
size
,
shape
and
color
of
the
colonies
,
diameter
of
zone
of
hemolysis
,
morphology
of
the
cells
and
the
chain
length
were
similar
in
all
the
strains
.

As
result
,
10
min
boiling
of
the
cells
in
2
-
mercaptoethanol
(
10
%
,
w
/
w
)
was
found
to
be
most
effective
with
respect
to
higher
yield
and
quality
of
the
protein
bands
observed
after
SDS
-
PAGE
(
data
not
shown
)
.

SDS
-
PAGE
of
secreted
proteins
did
not
reveal
any
difference
among
the
wild
-
type
strain
and
mutant
strains
(
data
not
shown
)
.

However
,
the
regulatory
mechanism
of
bac
gene
expression
has
not
been
studied
.

Similarly
,
ATP
-
binding
and
Mg2
+
-
binding
sites
located
at
C
-
terminal
end
of
Sak188
,
which
are
essential
for
phosphorylation
,
were
lost
in
Sak188
protein
due
to
the
mutagenesis
.

As
seen
from
the
Fig
.

Thus
,
we
can
conclude
that
sak188
and
bac
gene
are
not
in
the
operon
,
and
repression
of
bac
gene
transcription
in
sak189
/
sak188
double
mutant
strain
is
not
due
to
the
polar
effect
.

Given
that
insertional
inactivation
of
sak188
gene
does
not
affect
beta
-
antigen
expression
,
we
suggest
that
beta
-
antigen
expression
can
be
activated
independently
of
Sak188
,
perhaps
through
small
-
molecular
-
weight
phosphodonors
such
as
acetyl
phosphate
or
other
noncognate
histidine
kinases
.

Novel
Algorithms
Reveal
Streptococcal
Transcriptomes
and
Clues
about
Undefined
Genes

We
used
oligonucleotide
microarrays
to
monitor
(
in
vitro
)
differential
gene
expression
in
group
A
streptococci
during
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
,
the
first
overt
infection
stage
.

We
present
neighbor
clustering
,
a
new
computational
method
for
further
analyzing
bacterial
microarray
data
that
combines
two
informative
characteristics
of
bacterial
genes
that
share
common
function
or
regulation
:
(
1
)
similar
gene
expression
profiles
(
i
.
e
.
,
co
-
expression
)
;
and
(
2
)
physical
proximity
of
genes
on
the
chromosome
.

This
method
identifies
statistically
significant
clusters
of
co
-
expressed
gene
neighbors
that
potentially
share
common
function
or
regulation
by
coupling
statistically
analyzed
gene
expression
profiles
with
the
chromosomal
position
of
genes
.

We
assessed
the
biological
significance
of
two
identified
genes
by
assaying
deletion
mutants
for
adherence
in
vitro
and
show
that
neighbor
clustering
indeed
provides
biologically
relevant
data
.

Neighbor
clustering
provides
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
the
molecular
responses
of
streptococci
during
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
.

Introduction

Several
factors
,
however
,
limit
the
power
of
such
analyses
,
including
inadequate
statistical
analysis
and
insufficient
sample
replication
,
both
of
which
do
not
account
for
experimental
variability
,
and
often
result
in
arbitrary
thresholds
for
significance
[
1
,
2
]
.

Several
methods
are
available
to
organize
gene
expression
profiles
and
to
assist
in
extracting
functional
or
regulatory
gene
information
from
microarray
datasets
.

Because
no
tools
exist
to
interpret
unknown
gene
clusters
or
to
assess
their
significance
and
completeness
,
a
significant
portion
of
bacterial
expression
profiles
are
not
interpretable
using
current
clustering
methods
.

Information
about
gene
function
and
regulation
is
stored
intrinsically
in
the
bacterial
genome
structure
,
as
genes
with
common
function
or
regulation
tend
to
be
physically
proximate
on
the
chromosome
and
often
linked
as
operons
[
5
,
6
]
.

The
algorithms
also
recalculate
the
statistical
significance
of
each
gene
as
a
member
of
a
particular
cluster
,
as
well
as
the
significance
of
each
resulting
grouping
as
a
whole
,
to
ensure
accuracy
of
cluster
assignments
.

This
process
ultimately
identifies
significant
clusters
of
co
-
expressed
gene
neighbors
that
likely
share
common
function
or
regulation
.

We
used
this
approach
to
analyze
microarray
expression
data
from
group
A
streptococci
(
Streptococcus
pyogenes
)
during
adherence
to
human
pharyngeal
cells
,
the
first
overt
infection
step
[
7
]
.

We
compared
data
generated
before
and
after
neighbor
clustering
to
show
that
this
method
provides
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
transcription
by
:
(
1
)
identifying
more
differentially
expressed
genes
than
even
traditional
,
rigorous
statistical
analyses
;
(
2
)
reconstructing
intact
biological
pathways
that
statistical
significance
analysis
could
not
reconstruct
;
and
(
3
)
providing
preliminary
insight
and
clues
about
the
function
or
regulation
of
uncharacterized
genes
by
associating
their
co
-
expression
with
physically
proximate
,
functionally
defined
genes
.

Adherence
-
Mediated
Differential
Expression
We
developed
spotted
oligonucleotide
arrays
of
the
S
.
pyogenes
SF370
(
an
M1
serotype
)
genome
[
14
]
and
compared
the
transcriptomes
of
streptococci
that
adhere
to
Detroit
562
human
pharyngeal
cells
to
non
-
adherent
(
"
associated
"
)
streptococci
within
the
same
experiment
.

This
analysis
identified
79
genes
(
4
%
of
the
genome
)
exhibiting
statistically
significant
fold
changes
in
expression
(
PF
value
<
0
.
05
)
during
adherence
from
1
,
769
open
reading
frames
represented
on
the
array
(
Table
1
)
.

Genes
demonstrating
upregulation
(
n
=
45
)
and
downregulation
(
n
=
34
)
included
virulence
factors
,
prophage
-
encoded
transcripts
,
metabolic
genes
,
and
transcriptional
regulators
(
Table
2
)
.

Undefined
or
hypothetical
genes
comprised
27
%
of
differentially
expressed
genes
(
n
=
21
;
11
chromosomally
encoded
genes
,
ten
phage
-
encoded
genes
)
.

Five
genes
chosen
for
validation
demonstrated
statistically
significant
fold
changes
in
expression
by
microarray
analysis
(
PF
value
<
0
.
05
;
two
upregulated
,
three
downregulated
)
.

We
averaged
the
data
to
generate
a
value
for
each
gene
,
creating
a
set
of
11
paired
values
from
quantitative
real
-
time
(
qRT
)
-
PCR
and
microarray
analyses
(
Table
S3
)
.

Virulence
Factors

The
initial
statistical
analysis
identified
four
differentially
expressed
virulence
genes
(
Tables
1
and
2
)
.

We
verified
the
differential
expression
of
spy2039
and
spy0130
by
qRT
-
PCR
.

The
downregulation
of
virulence
loci
during
presumably
inappropriate
stages
of
infection
was
not
surprising
.

Streptolysin
O
is
a
cytotoxin
that
damages
human
tissue
and
increases
host
cell
cytotoxicity
[
7
,
25
]
.

Based
on
its
downregulation
during
adherence
,
we
infer
that
slo
was
transcribed
during
pre
-
adherence
associations
,
perhaps
,
as
previously
reported
,
to
protect
streptococci
from
phagocytic
killing
in
vivo
[
27
]
.

Although
few
studies
have
examined
gene
expression
patterns
during
adherence
,
SpeB
production
(
as
detected
by
Western
blot
analysis
)
decreases
during
co
-
culture
with
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
[
30
]
and
in
a
mouse
infection
model
[
31
]
.

When
SpeB
expression
is
limited
,
several
streptococcal
proteins
necessary
for
adherence
remain
intact
[
24
,
32
,
33
]
;
thus
,
decreased
SpeB
production
(
as
indicated
here
)
may
promote
pharyngeal
cell
attachment
.

We
observed
significant
upregulation
of
the
gene
spy0130
,
encoding
a
protein
recently
found
to
be
associated
with
the
production
of
surface
-
exposed
pili
on
strain
SF370
[
36
]
.

The
protein
shares
60
%
sequence
similarity
to
protein
F
,
suggesting
that
it
may
coordinate
a
similar
internalization
mechanism
or
may
be
involved
directly
in
adherence
(
discussed
later
in
detail
)
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
agree
with
previous
reports
on
SpeB
production
during
host
cell
interactions
,
suggesting
that
decreased
expression
may
promote
streptococcal
adherence
(
by
preventing
proteolytic
degradation
of
key
virulence
factors
or
adhesins
)
,
enhance
internalization
(
perhaps
through
a
fibronectin
-
mediated
pathway
)
,
and
increase
survival
(
through
increased
pyrogenic
exotoxin
production
,
discussed
below
)
.

We
identified
11
differentially
expressed
phage
370
.
2
genes
,
suggesting
that
this
defective
phage
is
not
transcriptionally
silent
(
Table
1
)
.

Adherence
-
mediated
upregulation
of
speH
is
likely
not
the
result
of
phage
induction
,
as
the
remaining
phage
370
.
2
genes
identified
in
our
analysis
were
downregulated
.

To
determine
if
SpeH
plays
a
direct
role
in
the
adherence
process
,
we
created
a
deletion
mutant
in
strain
SF370
(
SF370DeltaspeH
)
,
which
was
confirmed
by
PCR
(
unpublished
data
)
and
RT
-
PCR
(
Figure
1A
)
and
tested
in
vitro
for
adherence
to
human
pharyngeal
cells
.

We
observed
no
significant
difference
in
adherence
between
the
wild
-
type
(
SF370
)
and
mutant
strains
(
Figure
1B
)
,
indicating
that
SpeH
is
not
involved
directly
in
attachment
to
the
pharyngeal
cell
.

The
significant
upregulation
of
the
speH
gene
during
adherence
suggests
that
the
gene
product
may
function
instead
during
a
subsequent
stage
of
infection
.

For
example
,
genes
encoding
proteins
involved
in
folate
biosynthesis
[
40
]
were
upregulated
,
suggesting
that
certain
cofactors
that
may
be
necessary
during
adherence
were
unavailable
.

For
example
,
RopB
(
encoded
by
spy2042
)
,
a
member
of
the
Rgg
family
of
response
regulators
,
interacts
with
a
number
of
regulatory
networks
throughout
the
streptococcal
genome
(
e
.
g
.
,
mga
,
csrRS
,
sagA
,
and
fasBCA
)
,
affecting
the
transcription
of
numerous
proteins
,
virulence
factors
,
and
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
[
42
,
43
]
.

Although
the
delineation
of
genes
influenced
by
RopB
(
or
any
identified
transcriptional
regulator
)
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
study
,
our
initial
analysis
did
identify
the
upregulation
of
a
two
-
component
regulatory
system
,
encoded
by
spy1236
-
1237
.

The
functions
of
these
particular
loci
are
not
yet
known
,
and
their
adherence
-
mediated
upregulation
represents
new
targets
in
the
study
of
regulators
that
function
during
host
cell
contact
.

Because
the
genome
contains
many
possible
clusters
,
we
restricted
the
algorithm
'
s
search
space
to
identify
only
spatially
related
clusters
.

Because
individual
genes
could
be
members
of
many
different
significant
clusters
,
GenomeCrawler
then
applied
a
distinct
permutation
algorithm
to
calculate
the
probability
(
PC
)
that
a
gene
was
clustered
coincidentally
.

Calculation
of
PC
values
relies
on
Bayes
'
Theorem
,
in
which
the
probability
of
a
gene
'
s
log2
-
fold
change
(
PF
value
)
is
combined
with
the
cluster
probability
itself
(
PK
value
)
.

We
stress
that
PC
reflects
the
significance
of
a
gene
based
on
its
cluster
context
rather
than
a
recapitulation
of
PF
.

We
developed
a
plotting
application
(
GenomeSpyer
)
that
represents
the
chromosome
as
a
linear
molecule
to
visualize
GenomeCrawler
output
,
with
genes
displayed
on
the
x
-
axis
and
their
log2
-
fold
change
magnitudes
on
the
y
-
axis
.

We
visually
inspected
the
resulting
clusters
and
disqualified
those
that
violated
our
neighbor
cluster
definition
(
see
Methods
for
details
)
.

All
output
prior
to
cluster
disqualifications
is
included
for
comparison
(
see
Table
S4
)
.

Of
the
309
qualifying
clusters
(
Table
S5
)
,
197
(
63
.
8
%
)
were
composed
entirely
of
known
,
functionally
defined
genes
;
however
,
26
(
13
%
)
of
these
were
incorrectly
assembled
,
as
they
contained
known
genes
that
are
functionally
unrelated
.

Because
we
did
not
incorporate
functional
annotations
of
genes
into
the
algorithms
(
i
.
e
.
,
to
keep
the
analysis
"
blind
"
)
,
we
anticipated
the
possibility
that
some
groupings
could
be
assembled
incorrectly
despite
the
statistical
framework
for
assigning
clusters
.

We
present
examples
of
Type
I
and
II
clusters
:
Type
I
clusters
(
n
=
25
)
contained
only
functionally
defined
and
functionally
related
genes
(
as
reported
in
published
studies
)
,
such
as
biological
pathways
components
(
Figures
2B
and
S2
)
;
Type
II
clusters
(
n
=
20
)
included
both
known
and
unknown
genes
(
Figures
2C
and
S3
)
.

Type
III
clusters
(
n
=
2
)
were
composed
entirely
of
unknown
genes
(
Figures
2D
and
S4
)
,
and
are
not
discussed
in
detail
.

Type
I
Clusters
:
Intact
Metabolic
Pathways
and
Multimeric
Proteins

We
measured
the
performance
of
our
algorithm
by
examining
whether
it
identified
gene
groupings
known
to
be
functionally
related
(
Type
I
clusters
)
.

Only
four
(
16
%
)
of
25
Type

clusters
(
spy0080

,
spy1236
-
1237
,
spy1707
-
1711
,
spy2041
-
2042
)
could
have
been
identified
in
entirety
by
significance
analysis
because
all
clustered
genes
exhibited
significant
differential
expression
(
PF

<

GenomeCrawler
expanded
these
clusters
to
contain
more
genes
that
encode
intact
loci
(
Table
3
)
.

For
example
,
we
initially
identified
(
Table
1
)
the
significant
upregulation
of
three
of
the
five
known
gene
members
of
the
folate
biosynthetic
pathway
[
40
]
(
spy1096
-
1100
)
,
but
GenomeCrawler
identified
a
significant
cluster
containing
all
five
genes
(
Table
3
and
Figure
2B
)
.

We
obtained
a
similar
result
for
the
eight
-
gene
operon
encoding
the
F0F1
-
type
proton
translocating
ATPase
[
41
]
(
spy0754
-
0761
)
.

Each
of
the
11
neighbor
clusters
that
could
have
been
only
partially
identified
by
our
initial
analysis
alone
gained
gene
members
after
application
of
the
algorithms
and
became
more
complete
sets
of
functionally
related
genes
than
initially
identified
(
Table
3
)
.

These
clusters
encompass
various
metabolic
processes
,
including
purine
biosynthesis
(
spy0025
-
0028
)
,
lactose
metabolism
(
spy1916
-
1923
)
,
fatty
acid
biosynthesis
(
spy1743
-
1747
)
,
lipoteichoic
acid
synthesis
(
spy1308
-
1312
)
,
and
sugar
phosphotransferase
transport
(
spy1058
-
1060
)
[
14
]
,
suggesting
that
specific
changes
occur
in
the
streptococcal
metabolic
program
as
the
bacteria
adhere
to
human
pharyngeal
cells
in
vitro
.

If
transcription
is
internally
disrupted
by
such
a
terminator
,
the
abundance
of
the
sagA
transcript
may
be
much
greater
than
the
polycistronic
message
;
such
disproportionate
transcript
levels
would
affect
log2
-
fold
change
values
and
impact
the
statistical
significance
of
individual
genes
within
these
types
of
clusters
.

Thus
,
in
addition
to
helping
resolve
clusters
that
would
not
be
easily
recognized
because
of
experimental
technical
variability
,
the
neighbor
clustering
method
may
help
to
resolve
operons
with
such
internal
terminators
and
regulators
.

Curating
the
dataset
following
its
application
may
make
the
algorithms
less
user
-
friendly
;
however
,
the
elimination
of
such
bias
is
essential
for
this
type
of
analysis
.

Type
II
Clusters

Based
on
the
Type
I
cluster
results
,
we
speculated
that
genes
contained
in
Type
II
clusters
might
be
related
by
function
or
regulation
.

A
total
of
18
(
90
%
)
of
20
Type
II
clusters
(
Table
3
and
Figure
S3
)
may
not
have
been
identified
without
neighbor
clustering
:
eight
(
44
.
4
%
)
of
18
gained
additional
gene
members
;
the
remaining
ten
comprised
genes
that
demonstrated
significant
differential
expression
only
after
applying
GenomeCrawler
.

Only
two
clusters
(
spy0127
-
0130
and
spy1701
-
1704
)
could
have
been
identified
without
neighbor
clustering
;
however
,
a
number
of
these
genes
were
initially
annotated
as
hypothetical
proteins
,
so
a
potential
relationship
between
the
gene
members
may
not
have
been
readily
apparent
.

A
search
of
both
the
PFAM
database
[
47
]
(
http
:

)
and
sortase
database
(
http

doe

ucla

Services
/
Sortase
)
predicted
that
spy0129
encodes
a
sortase
enzyme
,
which
are
transpeptidases
that
cleave
protein
substrates
at
conserved
C
-
terminal
motifs
(
often
LPXTG
)
and
then
anchor
these
proteins
to
the
bacterial
cell
wall
[
48
,
49
]
.

This
same
report
provided
the
first
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
sortase
prediction
,
indicating
that
the
gene
product
of
spy0129
is
responsible
for
the
cell
-
wall
sorting
of
the
proteins
encoded
by
both
spy0128
(
annotated
as
a
Cpa
homolog
[
50
]
)
and
spy0130
(
annotated
as
a
protein
F
homolog
[
14
]
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
spy0128
-
encoded
protein
is
the
structural
backbone
of
the
pili
,
and
the
gene
product
of
spy0130
may
be
involved
in
stabilizing
the
structure
[
36
]
.

We
determined
experimentally
that
cluster
spy0127
-
0130
is
an
operon
,
verifying
both
related
function
and
regulation
of
the
gene
members
.

Reverse
transcription
of
SF370
RNA
,
with
primer
combinations
that
spanned
all
four
genes
,
produced
cDNA
fragments
of
sizes
that
could
only
result
from
a
polycistronic
mRNA
template
(
Figure
3
)
.

In
silico
sequence
inspection
identified
a
single
putative
promoter
sequence
upstream
of
spy0127
(
see
Table
S6
)
.

Allelic
Replacement
of
spy0129

In
vitro
pharyngeal
cell
adherence
assays
revealed
that
the
SF370Deltaspy0129
.
2
mutant
was
approximately
66
%
less
adherent
than
the
parental
control
strain
,
SF370
(
Figure
4B
;
p
=
0
.
03
as
determined
by
the
Student
'
s
t
-
test
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
either
the
spy0130
gene
product
is
involved
directly
in
adherence
,
or
that
due
to
the
elimination
of
the
sortase
,
the
pili
,
which
may
function
in
their
entirety
as
adhesins
,
were
not
assembled
on
the
surface
of
the
mutant
.

BlastP
analysis
aligned
the
spy1725
gene
product
,
which
has
homologs
in
all
sequenced
streptococcal
genomes
,
with
the
SP14
.
3
protein
from
S
.
pneumoniae
[
52
]
(
80
%
sequence
similarity
;
67
%
identity
)
.

The
spy1723
gene
product
has
similar
domain
structure
to
the
YlxR
protein
of
S
.
pneumoniae
,
an
RNA
-
binding
protein
implicated
in
transcription
termination
[
53
]
.

These
results
indicate
that
both
genes
likely
encode
RNA
-
binding
proteins
,
in
agreement
with
their
functionally
defined
cluster
members
.

Although
domain
and
homology
searches
yielded
the
functional
predictions
,
their
membership
within
a
protein
biosynthetic
cluster
provided
the
initial
indication
of
common
function
or
regulation
.

The
Mga
regulator
is
a
growth
-
phase
mediator
of
a
number
of
surface
-
exposed
molecules
and
secreted
proteins
involved
in
colonization
and
immune
evasion
during
infection
[
58
]
.

We
suspect
that
this
discrepancy
results
from
different
normalization
methods
used
,
or
from
different
methods
that
were
applied
to
analyze
the
ratio
of
signal
intensities
between
sample
and
control
(
i
.
e
.
,
we
analyzed
the
ratios
of
the
median
rather
than
the
ratios
of
the
mean
[
57
]
)
.

Although
the
published
report
did
not
include
statistical
analysis
of
the
data
,
we
note
that
the
statistical
analysis
that
we
performed
identified
four
genes
with
significant
log2
-
fold
changes
in
expression
(
PF
<
0
.
05
;
Table
S8
)
.

These
groupings
included
clusters
of
genes
that
have
been
shown
previously
in
streptococci
to
be
functionally
related
,
indicating
that
the
algorithms
were
performing
as
expected
.

GenomeCrawler
confirmed
these
results
by
identifying
both
groupings
as
statistically
significant
neighbor
clusters
.

For
example
,
the
algorithm
identified
a
significant
neighbor
cluster
spanning
spy0711
-
0712
.

However
,
these
results
provided
further
supporting
evidence
that
the
GenomeCrawler
algorithms
can
identify
(
1
)
a
larger
group
of
genes
than
a
rigorous
statistical
analysis
alone
and
(
2
)
biologically
relevant
groupings
in
other
microarray
datasets
,
even
if
they
contain
fewer
replicates
than
presented
in
our
study
.

Although
GenomeCrawler
improves
bacterial
array
analyses
,
it
has
limitations
:
it
cannot
identify
regulons
comprising
genes
dispersed
throughout
the
genome
by
virtue
of
its
design
,
it
does
not
specifically
interrogate
single
-
gene
operons
,
and
it
only
applies
to
genomes
with
available
and
accurate
experimental
information
(
expression
data
and
gene
annotations
)
.

Adding
available
clusters
of
orthologous
groups
(
COG
)
information
into
a
downstream
processing
step
could
decrease
errors
by
minimizing
clustering
of
unrelated
genes
.

Nonetheless
,
neighbor
clustering
provided
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
the
transcriptome
of
group
A
streptococci
during
adherence
to
human
pharyngeal
cells
,
a
critical
step
in
the
infection
program
of
this
organism
.

We
found
that
even
a
rigorous
statistical
analysis
of
well
-
replicated
microarray
data
produced
a
dataset
that
was
somewhat
limited
,
although
certainly
more
informative
than
assigning
arbitrary
thresholds
for
significance
.

As
described
in
other
microarray
reports
,
we
had
initially
identified
a
number
of
incomplete
biological
pathways
in
which
we
did
not
detect
the
differential
expression
of
a
number
of
known
pathway
members
.

Neighbor
clustering
was
able
to
extend
the
results
by
identifying
more
differentially
expressed
genes
and
reconstructing
more
intact
biological
pathways
.

Neighbor
clustering
,
despite
the
statistical
framework
with
which
it
assigns
groupings
,
would
be
valuable
to
microarray
data
analysis
only
if
it
produced
biologically
relevant
data
.

It
is
also
possible
that
GenomeCrawler
(
in
its
current
form
)
could
be
used
to
interrogate
intergenic
portions
of
the
genome
(
such
as
those
encoding
small
noncoding
RNAs
or
sRNAs
)
,
if
probes
representing
such
regions
were
included
on
the
microarray
,
and
experimental
conditions
were
designed
to
promote
their
differential
expression
.

Finally
,
because
of
the
common
architecture
of
bacterial
chromosomes
,
the
neighbor
clustering
algorithms
may
be
applicable
to
microarray
datasets
from
other
prokaryotes
.

Porphyromonas
gingivalis
possesses
two
distinct
fimbriae
.

The
authors
have
recently
demonstrated
that
both
fimbriae
are
required
for
formation
of
P
.
gingivalis
biofilms
.

It
is
also
a
pathogen
that
may
be
involved
in
coronary
heart
disease
and
preterm
births
(
Boggess
et
al
.
,
2005
;
Brodala
et
al
.
,
2005
;
Chou
et
al
.
,
2005
)
.

Two
distinct
fimbriae
are
found
on
the
surface
of
the
organism
(
Dickinson
et
al
.
,
1988
;
Hamada
et
al
.
,
1996
)
.

The
long
(
major
)
filamentous
structure
is
comprised
of
a
FimA
subunit
protein
encoded
by
the
fimA
gene
.

Both
fimbriae
appear
to
be
involved
in
bacterial
pathogenicity
(
Amano
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

The
function
of
the
FimA
protein
and
regulation
of
fimA
expression
have
been
extensively
studied
.

The
FimA
protein
is
required
for
P
.
gingivalis
colonization
on
salivary
coated
surfaces
,
and
the
early
colonization
of
dental
plaque
(
Malek
et
al
.
,
1994
;
Levesque
et
al
.
,
2003
;
Maeda
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

Earlier
studies
by
the
authors
showed
that
FimA
expression
was
modulated
by
environmental
cues
,
including
temperature
and
hemin
concentration
,
and
by
the
presence
of
Streptococcus
cristatus
,
an
early
colonizer
of
dental
plaque
(
Xie
et
al
.
,
1997
,
2000b
)
.

FimR
,
a
response
regulator
of
the
fimS
/
fimR
two
-
component
system
was
identified
,
and
FimA
expression
was
found
to
be
dramatically
reduced
in
fimR
mutants
(
Hayashi
et
al
.
,
2000
)
.

Investigation
of
the
mechanism
of
regulation
of
fimA
by
FimR
indicates
that
FimR
does
not
bind
directly
to
the
fimA
promoter
,
but
rather
binds
to
the
promoter
region
of
the
first
gene
(
pg2130
)
in
the
fimA
cluster
,
suggesting
that
PG2130
is
the
FimR
target
gene
,
which
in
turn
regulates
expression
of
other
genes
in
the
fimA
cluster
,
including
the
fimA
gene
(
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

The
short
fimbriae
(
Mfa1
)
also
contribute
to
P
.
gingivalis
colonization
.

Coadhesion
and
biofilm
development
between
P
.
gingivalis
and
Streptococcus
gordonii
require
the
interaction
of
Mfa1
with
streptococcal
protein
SspB
(
Park
et
al
.
,
2005
)
.

A
mutant
with
a
deficiency
in
minor
fimbriae
binds
to
a
saliva
-
coated
surface
but
does
not
form
microcolonies
as
the
wild
-
type
strain
does
.

In
a
nutrient
-
limited
medium
,
expression
of
FimA
and
Mfa1
are
inhibited
in
P
.
gingivalis
,
whereas
such
differences
are
not
found
in
gingipain
expression
.

A
recent
study
has
shown
that
expression
of
mfa1
is
repressed
in
the
presence
of
some
common
oral
plaque
bacteria
such
as
S
.
gordonii
,
Streptococcus
sanguinis
and
Streptococcus
mitis
(
Park
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

However
,
very
little
is
known
about
regulatory
mechanisms
of
mfa1
expression
.

In
this
study
,
it
is
demonstrated
that
FimR
is
a
positive
regulator
of
Mfa1
expression
.

Evidence
is
provided
that
unlike
FimR
-
dependent
fimA
expression
,
FimR
regulates
mfa1
expression
by
directly
binding
to
the
promoter
region
of
mfa1
.

Results

Role
of
FimR
in
mfa1
expression
The
fimA
gene
is
the
only
gene
known
to
be
tightly
controlled
by
the
FimS
/
FimR
system
.

To
investigate
effects
of
FimR
on
expression
of
the
mfa1
gene
,
an
insertional
fimR
mutant
was
constructed
by
allelic
replacement
.

As
shown
in
Fig
.

This
result
is
consistent
with
previous
observations
(
Hayashi
et
al
.
,
2000
;
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

The
striking
finding
is
that
expression
of
the
mfa1
gene
was
also
repressed
threefold
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
although
not
to
the
degree
observed
with
the
fimA
expression
.

To
determine
production
of
long
(
major
)
and
short
(
minor
)
fimbriae
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
western
blotting
was
performed
with
a
polyclonal
anti
-
FimA
or
anti
-
Mfa1
antibody
to
compare
fimbrial
production
in
wild
-
type
strain
(
33277
)
,
the
fimR
-
mutant
(
FRE
)
,
the
fimA
-
mutant
(
FAT
)
and
the
mfa1
-
mutant
(
MFAE
)
.

This
analysis
revealed
that
the
expression
of
the
fimA
and
mfa1
genes
was
consistent
at
the
mRNA
level
and
protein
level
(
Fig
.
1b
)
.

FimA
protein
was
not
detectable
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
while
a
50
%
lower
level
of
Mfa1
protein
was
found
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
compared
with
that
in
wild
-
type
strain
33277
.

Similarly
,
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
RgpA
production
in
the
fimR
-
mutant
,
which
was
detected
by
anti
-
RgpA
serum
.

Identification
of
the
transcriptional
start
site
of
the
mfa1
gene

The
transcriptional
start
site
(
the
A
)
of
mfa1
was
at
434
bp
upstream
from
the
potential
start
codon
(
Fig
.
2b
)
.

To
verify
the
result
,
the
RACE
experiment
was
repeated
with
mfa1
-
specific
reverse
primers
MfaTSR3
and
MfaTSR4
located
at
237
bp
upstream
of
the
potential
start
codon
.

2c
,
the
PCR
product
was
generated
only
with
primers
MfaTSF1
(
corresponding
to
+
6
to
+
25
)
and
MfaTSR5
(
+
805
to
+
824
)
.

This
transcriptional
start
site
is
390
bp
upstream
of
the
site
previously
reported
(
Park
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

Binding
of
FimR
to
the
promoter
region
of
mfa1

It
was
postulated
that
different
mechanisms
might
be
involved
in
FimR
-
mediated
mfa1
expression
,
since
expression
regulation
of
mfa1
by
FimR
was
not
controlled
as
tightly
as
observed
for
fimA
expression
.

The
mfa1
promoter
(
positioned
from
+
18
to
-
138
)
,
fimA
promoter
(
positioned
from
-
22
to
-
190
)
(
Xie
&
Lamont
,
1999
)
and
mfa1
coding
DNA
(
positioned
from
+
1253
to
+
1373
)
were
generated
by
PCR
with
the
5
'
biotin
-
labeled
primers

The
rHGP44
protein
,
a

domain
of
P
.
gingivalis
gingipains
(
Xie
et
al
.
,
2006
)
,
expressed
in
the
same
system
and
purified
by
the
same
procedures
as
rFimR
was
used
as
a
control
.

Cold
competitor
chase
experiments
with
a
100
-
fold
excess
of
unlabeled
DNA
probe
as
a
specific
competitor
were
also
used
to
demonstrate
the
specificity
of
rFimR
binding
.

As
shown
in
Fig
.

As
the
concentration
of
rFimR
increased
,
the
retarded
protein
-
DNA
complex
became
evident
,
with
complete
loss
of
the
mfa1
promoter
DNA
.

No
significant
difference
was
detected
in
the
level
of
DNA
binding
between
the
phosphorylated
rFimR
and
unphosphorylated
rFimR
(
data
not
shown
)
.

There
was
also
no
DNA
shift
detected
when
rFimR
was
incubated
with
the
coding
region
of
mfa1
.

These
data
clearly
show
that
FimR
protein
can
bind
specifically
to
the
mfa1
promoter
region
,
acting
as
an
activator
of
mfa1
transcription
.

EMSA
experiments
were
also
performed
to
examine
whether
the
rFimR
binds
to
the
other
promoter
region
identified
by
Park
et
al
.

Discussion

The
two
-
component
regulatory
system
is
a
major
mechanism
of
signal
transduction
and
is
widespread
in
bacteria
.

Although
most
target
genes
of
P
.
gingivalis
two
-
component
systems
are
unknown
,
the
role
of
the
FimS
/
FimR
in
expression
of
the
fimA
gene
is
well
defined
.

Expression
of
minor
fimbriae
(
mfa1
)
in
a
fimR
mutanthas
been
investigated
.

A
comparison
of
the
transcriptional
level
of
the
mfa1
in
P
.
gingivalis
wild
-
type
strain
and
in
the
fimR
mutant
indicates
that
the
FimS
/
FimR
system
is
a
positive
regulator
for
the
mfa1
gene
,
although
the
system
controls
two
fimbrial
genes
at
different
levels
.

The
previous
study
suggested
that
regulation
of
fimA
expression
by
FimR
is
through
a
regulation
cascade
involving
interaction
of
FimR
and
the
promoter
region
of
the
first
gene
in
the
fimA
cluster
(
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

It
has
also
been
reported
previously
that
the
transcriptional
activity
of
fimA
was
reduced
in
the
fimA
mutant
,
indicating
multiple
levels
of
control
of
fimA
expression
in
P
.
gingivalis
(
Xie
et
al
.
,
2000a
)
.

However
,
the
possibility
cannot
be
excluded
that
other
regulatory
elements
are
also
involved
in
expression
of
the
mfa1
gene
.

However
,
no
apparent
difference
was
found
in
DNA
-
binding
affinity
between
rFimRs
with
or
without
acetyl
phosphate
treatment
.

Observation
suggests
that
different
mechanisms
may
be
involved
in
P
.
gingivalis
FimR
activation
.

Activation
of
a
regulatory
protein
not
corresponding
to
phosphorylation
was
also
observed
in
Streptococcus
mutans
(
Biswas
&
Biswas
,
2006
)
.

Phosphorylation
of
CovR
,
a
global
response
regulator
,
had
no
effect
on
its
DNA
-
binding
affinity
.

Data
of
this
study
suggest
that
transcription
of
the
mfa1
gene
originated
at
a
distal
upstream
transcriptional
start
site
and
read
through
the
promoter
region
suggested
by
Park
et
al
.

(
2006
)
.

Moreover
,
FimR
appears
to
act
on
the
promoter
region
identified
here
,
suggesting
that
this
promoter
may
make
significant
contributions
toward
mfa1
expression
through
the
FimS
/
FimR
system
.

Gene
expression
under
the
control
of
two
promoters
is
not
uncommon
in
bacteria
.

In
E
.
coli
,
two
promoters
direct
transcription
of
acs
encoding
,
an
acetate
-
scavenging
enzyme
required
for
fitness
during
periods
of
carbon
starvation
-
the
distal
acsP1
and
the
proximal
acsP2
(
Beatty
et
al
.
,
2003
)
.

It
is
suggested
that
each
promoter
may
interact
with
different
regulatory
elements
.

A
cascade
regulation
starting
with
FimR
appears
to
act
on
the
upstream
promoter
(
Nishikawa
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

The
hypothesis
is
currently
under
investigation
.

In
conclusion
,
P
.
gingivalis
fimbriae
play
a
predominant
role
in
the
attachment
of
the
organism
to
a
variety
of
oral
surfaces
(
Lamont
&
Jenkinson
,
2000
;
Amano
et
al
.
,
2004
)
,
although
other
surface
proteins
,
such
as
gingipains
,
may
also
be
involved
in
the
bacterial
colonization
(
Tokuda
et
al
.
,
1996
;
Chen
et
al
.
,
2001
)
.

It
has
been
recently
reported
by
the
authors
that
both
major
fimbriae
and
minor
fimbriae
contribute
to
the
formation
of
P
.
gingivalis
biofilm
(
Lin
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

Major
fimbriae
are
required
for
initial
attachment
and
the
minor
fimbriae
appear
to
play
an
important
role
in
microcolony
formation
by
facilitating
cell
-
cell
interactions
.

Therefore
,
it
is
proposed
that
FimR
can
be
an
attractive
target
for
inhibition
of
P
.
gingivalis
colonization
.

Secretion
and
Specific
T
Cell
Recognition
by
PhoP

Two
of
the
most
widely
used
attenuated
strains
in
the
history
of
tuberculosis
research
are
Mycobacterium
bovis
BCG
(
BCG
)
and
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
H37Ra
(
H37Ra
)
,
which
both
lost
their
virulence
during
in
vitro
serial
passage
.

Whereas
the
attenuation
of
BCG
is
due
mainly
to
loss
of
the
ESAT
-
6
secretion
system
,
ESX
-
1
,
the
reason
why
H37Ra
is
attenuated
remained
unknown
.

Only
H37Ra

-
ins
"
that
carried
an
integrated
cosmid
with
the
wild
-
type
phoP
gene
from
M
.
tuberculosis
H37Rv
showed
changes
in
colony
morphology
,
increased
virulence
,
ESAT
-
6
secretion
,
and
induction
of
specific
T
cell
responses
,
whereas
other
H37Ra
constructs
did
not
.

Among
the
different
possibilities
to
obtain
new
insight
into
the
mechanisms
employed
by
M
.
tuberculosis
to
infect
its
host
,
the
analysis
of
attenuated
strains
is
one
promising
approach
,
and
there
are
some
well
-
documented
examples
of
laboratory
-
attenuated
strains
.

Another
famous
example
of
an
attenuated
strain
is
M
.
tuberculosis
H37Ra
(
"
a
"
for
avirulent
)
(
H37Ra
)
.

This
strain
was
obtained
in
1934
by
serial
passage
of
patient
isolate
M
.
tuberculosis
H37
through
media
with
different
pHs
[
6
]
and
since
then
has
been
widely
used
in
many
laboratories
in
the
world
.

As
H37Ra
is
derived
from
the
same
parent
strain
as
M
.
tuberculosis
H37Rv
(
"
v
"
for
virulent
)
(
H37Rv
)
,
the
sequenced
paradigm
strain
of
tuberculosis
research
[
7
]
,
genomic
comparisons
of
the
attenuated
and
virulent
variants
of
M
.
tuberculosis
H37
are
particularly
interesting
and
have
the
potential
to
identify
subtle
genetic
changes
that
might
be
responsible
for
the
phenotypic
differences
observed
between
the
two
strains
.

In
a
previous
study
we
have
tried
to
reveal
these
determinants
[
8
]
,
but
the
methods
employed
only
identified
large
genetic
polymorphisms
,
associated
with
IS6110
,
which
were
not
found
to
be
responsible
for
the
attenuation
of
H37Ra
[
8
]
.

[
9
]
transformed
a
cosmid
library
of
H37Rv
into
H37Ra
and
then
selected
for
clones
that
were
enriched
on
passage
through
the
mouse
.

H37Ra
was
also
the
subject
of
extensive
micro
-
array
based
analyses
,
including
whole
genome
comparative
DNA
/
DNA
analyses
[
10
]
and
transcriptional
studies
[
11
,
12
]
,
which
have
identified
some
candidate
genes
that
were
consistently
downregulated
.

This
technique
has
previously
permitted
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
of
a
PA
-
824
drug
resistant
mutant
strain
of
H37Rv
to
be
detected
[
13
]
.

This
approach
was
combined
with
gene
"
knock
-
in
"
strategies
,
to
complement
selected
lesions
,
that
allowed
recombinant
H37Ra
strains
to
be
engineered
,
whose
virulence
and
immunogenicity
were
then
evaluated
in
in
vitro
,
ex
vivo
and
animal
models
.

H37Ra
The
genome
-
wide
comparative
mutational
analysis
of
H37Ra
and
H37Rv
was
carried
out
by
NimbleGen
Systems
following
a
previously
published
method
[
13
]
.

By
this
combined
approach
we
identified
13
non
-
synonymous
SNPs
that
differed
between
the
H37Ra
and
H37Rv
strains
used
(
Table
S1
)
.

We
were
particularly
interested
in
a
C
to
T
mutation
responsible
for
the
serine
to
leucine
replacement
at
position
219
,
S219L
,
of
the
two
-
component
regulator
PhoP
as
this
protein
is
well
known
for
its
involvement
in
the
virulent
phenotype
of
M
.
tuberculosis
[
14
]
.

While
writing
this
article
,
the
whole
genome
sequence
of
H37Ra
became
publicly
available
(
NC
_
009525
)
,
and
comparison
of
the
SNP
data
obtained
from
the
H37Ra
strain
used
in
our
laboratory
(
Table
S1
)
with
the
NC
_
009525
data
,
showed
that
some
differences
existed
between
the
H37Ra
strains
,
a
phenomenon
which
was
also
previously
observed
for
BCG
[
4
]
and
H37Rv
[
17
]
.

Nevertheless
,
the
S129L
mutation
in
PhoP
,
which
we
consider
an
important
SNP
involved
in
the
attenuation
and
reduced
immunogenicity
of
H37Ra
,
is
identical
in
all
H37Ra
strains
.

To
evaluate
the
phenotypic
effect
of
the
different
SNPs
and
to
assess
their
potential
contribution
to
the
attenuation
process
,
we
undertook
functional
genomic
analyses
using
knock
-
ins
of
H37Ra
,
as
described
previously
[
18
]
.

By
this
approach
we
obtained
appropriately
complemented
transformants
for
the
SNPs
in
genes
fadE5
,
rpsL
,
and
phoP
(
Table
S1
)
,
using
cosmids
I230
,
I563
,
and
I36
,
respectively
.

Figure
S1
shows
part
of
the
nucleotide
sequence
of
a
PCR
-
amplified
fragment
obtained
from
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
.

It
is
clearly
visible
that
at
nucleotide
position
656
of
phoP
two
peaks
exist
,
one
originating
from
the
SNP
present
in
H37Ra
and
one
from
the
integrated
cosmid
I36
carrying
the
H37Rv
wild
-
type
copy
of
phoP
.

Correct
integration
of
I36
was
also
confirmed
by
Southern
blot
.

The
successful
integration
of
the
cosmid
was
also
reflected
by
a
change
in
colony
morphology
that
is
shown
in
Figure
S3
.

Ex
Vivo
Virulence
Studies

In
a
first
attempt
to
determine
the
virulence
of
the
complemented
H37Ra
knock
-
in
strains
relative
to
wild
-
type
H37Ra
and
H37Rv
,
bone
marrow
-
derived
murine
macrophages
(
BMM
)
were
infected
with
the
different
strains
at
a
multiplicity
of
infection
(
MOI
)
of
1
:
1
and
10
:
1
bacteria
per
cell
.

As
depicted
in
Figure
1
,
macrophages
were
able
to
control
ex
vivo
growth
of
H37Ra
,
but
failed
to
control
growth
of
H37Rv
,
confirming
results
from
Freeman
and
colleagues
[
20
]
.

When
H37Ra
knock
-
ins
were
tested
,
important
differences
in
their
ex
vivo
growth
characteristics
were
found
.

Whereas
H37Ra
:
:
fadE5
(
Figure
1
)
and
H37Ra
:
:
rpsL
(
unpublished
data
)
showed
very
little
or
no
growth
over
the
7
-
d
period
,
the
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
mutant
grew
more
vigorously
,
with
a
7
.
5
-
fold
increase
in
colony
-
forming
units
(
CFU
)
over
the
7
-
d
period
.

From
these
experiments
we
concluded
that
complementation
of
H37Ra
with
the
phoP
wild
-
type
copy
partially
restored
its
virulence
,
but
not
to
the
extent
of
the
fully
virulent
H37Rv
strain
.

Virulence
Studies
of
H37Ra
Complemented
Mutants
in
a
Mouse
Model

Further
assessment
of
the
in
vivo
growth
of
different
H37Ra
knock
-
in
strains
was
carried
out
by
intravenous
infection
of
severe
combined
immuno
-
deficient
(
SCID
)
mice
.

However
,
as
already
observed
in
macrophages
,
integration
of
phoP
did
not
restore
levels
of
virulence
to
those
of
the
reference
strain
H37Rv
(
Figure
2
)
.

Together
with
the
data
from
the
macrophage
infection
assay
,
the
results
from
the
mouse
infection
show
that
the
S219L
mutation
in
the
phoP
gene
definitely
represents
one
genetic
lesion
that
contributed
to
the
attenuation
of
the
H37Ra
strain
.

Two
weeks
after
vaccination
we
assessed
the
interferon
-
gamma
(
IFN
-
gamma
)
production
of
splenocytes
mounted
against
ESX
-
1
antigens
or
controls
.

Most
importantly
,
the
various
strains
differed
extensively
in
their
potential
to
induce
antigen
specific
T
cell
responses
towards
ESAT
-
6
and
CFP
-
10
.

As
shown
in
Figure
3
,
splenocytes
from
mice
that
were
inoculated
with
H37Rv
produced
high
amounts
of
IFN
-
gamma
upon
stimulation
with
ESAT
-
6
or
CFP
-
10
,
whereas
the
responses
of
H37Ra
,
H37Ra
:
:
fadE5
,
and
H37Ra
:
:
rpsL
infected
mice
were
extremely
weak
.

Exactly
the
same
trend
was
observed
when
a
highly
sensitive
T
cell
hybridoma
assay
was
used
to
investigate
ESAT
-
6
secretion
.

This
test
is
based
on
the
presentation
of
the
immunodominant
epitope
contained
in
the
first
20
amino
acids
of
ESAT
-
6
by
H37Ra
,
recombinant
H37Ra
,
or
H37Rv
infected
bone
marrow
-
derived
dendritic
cells
(
BM
-
DC
)
to
an
ESAT
-
6
-
specific
T
cell
hybridoma
(
NB11
)
,
restricted
by
I
-
Ab
.

To
further
evaluate
the
involvement
of
phoP
and
the
ESX
-
1
system
in
immunogenicity
,
C57BL
/
6
mice
were
vaccinated
with
additional
strains
.

Firstly
,
we
constructed
a
partially
diploid
H37Ra
knock
-
in
strain
carrying
cosmid
RD1
-
ppe68
-
ko
that
,
in
BCG
yields
the
greatest
amounts
of
ESAT
-
6
expression
and
secretion
[
24
]
.

However
,
in
H37Ra
the
presence
of
this
cosmid
could
not
increase
the
weak
ESAT
-
6
and
CFP
-
10
T
cell
responses
(
Figure
3B
)
in
the
splenocyte
IFN
-
gamma
assay
.

However
,
in
comparison
to
the
corresponding
MT103
wild
-
type
strain
,
the
SO2
strain
showed
a
strongly
reduced
ESAT
-
6
and
CFP
-
10
specific
T
cell
response
,
corresponding
to
a
similar
low
level
as
the
H37Ra
strain
(
Figure
3B
)
.

The
western
blot
analysis
presented
in
Figure
5
shows
that
the
cell
lysates
of
H37Ra
and
H37Ra
:
:
rpsL
contain
large
amounts
of
ESAT
-
6
,
indicating
that
the
antigen
is
properly
expressed
.

However
,
hardly
any
ESAT
-
6
was
present
in
the
culture
filtrates
of
these
cultures
,
indicating
that
these
strains
were
unable
to
secrete
ESAT
-
6
under
the
in
vitro
conditions
employed
in
spite
of
proper
expression
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
for
H37Ra
:
:
fadE5
(
unpublished
data
)
.

In
a
previous
report
[
25
]
,
the
presence
of
ESAT
-
6
in
cell
free
extracts
was
described
for
this
strain
,
but
no
secretion
assay
was
performed
.

Together
,
our
findings
correlate
perfectly
with
the
in
vivo
data
described
above
and
suggest
that
the
lack
of
ESAT
-
6
specific
T
cell
recognition
for
H37Ra
,
H37Ra
:
:
fadE5
,
H37Ra
:
:
rpsL
,
and
SO2
is
not
caused
by
a
loss
of
ESAT
-
6
expression
,
but
rather
due
to
a
failure
of
(
phoP
dependent
)
ESAT
-
6
secretion
.

The
observation
that
knocking
-
in
the
ESX
-
1
region
of
H37Rv
into
H37Ra
(
H37Ra
:
:
RD1
-
ppe68
-
ko
)
,
and
the
resultant
diploidy
,
did
not
improve
the
ESAT
-
6
-
specific
T
cell
responses
(
Figure
3B
)
,
further
argues
that
PhoP
-
dependent
ESAT
-
secretion
might
be
regulated
via
a
mechanism
that
lies
outside
the
RD1
region
.

As
closer
inspection
of
the
available
literature
on
transcriptional
analyses
of
a
H37Rv
-
phoP
ko
strain
[
21
]
and
H37Ra
[
12
]
suggested
that
the
expression
of
gene
cluster
rv3612c
-
rv3616c
is
reduced
in
both
strains
,
we
evaluated
the
expression
level
of
rv3614c
in
H37Rv
,
H37Ra
,
and
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
by
quantitative
real
time
PCR
(
qRT
-
PCR
)
.

In
previous
studies
rv3614c
,
rv3615c
,
rv3616c
(
espA
)
were
independently
shown
to
be
essential
for
proper
ESAT
-
6
secretion
[
27
,
28
]
.

We
confirmed
the
trend
that
rv3614c
was
expressed
much
lower
in
H37Ra
compared
to
H37Rv
by
qRT
-
PCR
(
Figure
6
)
,
whereas
expression
of
rv3614c
in
H37Ra
:
:
phoP
was
restored
to
wild
-
type
levels
,
suggesting
that
the
rv3612c
-
rv3616c
gene
cluster
is
regulated
by
PhoP
.

Interestingly
,
expression
of
phoP
was
higher
in
H37Ra
than
in
H37Rv
(
Figure
6
)
.

These
findings
are
consistent
with
data
from
a
previous
transcriptional
study
[
12
]
and
suggest
that
the
proposed
ability
of
PhoP
to
downregulate
its
own
expression
[
22
]
is
affected
by
the
S219L
phoP
mutation
[
29
]
.

They
also
indicate
that
it
is
not
a
lack
of
phoP
expression
that
is
causing
the
phoP
-
associated
effects
in
H37Ra
.

Discussion

The
attenuated
H37Ra
strain
was
obtained
at
the
Trudeau
Institute
in
the
1930s
in
an
attempt
to
dissociate
virulent
and
avirulent
forms
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
H37
.

Steenken
et
al
.
have
shown
that
the
virulence
of
the
H37
strain
was
associated
with
colony
morphology
and
that
the
avirulent
variant
H37Ra
failed
to
propagate
in
an
ordinarily
susceptible
host
while
the
virulent
variant
H37Rv
was
able
to
proliferate
[
6
]
.

For
M
.
tuberculosis
,
several
studies
have
described
a
link
between
the
inactivation
of
phoP
and
loss
of
virulence
,
suggesting
that
the
phoP
gene
is
required
for
intracellular
growth
of
M
.
tuberculosis
[
14
,
25
]
.

However
,
according
to
very
recent
information
,
these
polyketide
-
derived
(
Pks2
-
4
)
lipids
do
not
have
a
strong
impact
on
the
virulence
of
M
.
tuberculosis
[
29
]
.

That
study
identified
44
genes
in
the
phoP
-
ko
strain
that
were
expressed
at
least
2
.
5
-
fold
lower
in
the
mutant
than
their
counterparts
in
the
M
.
tuberculosis
wild
-
type
strain
.

Among
the
genes
expressed
at
low
level
in
the
phoP
-
ko
strain
and
in
H37Ra
were
several
that
are
involved
in
lipid
metabolism
;
for
example
,
the
polyketide
synthases
pks2
(
rv3825c
)
or
the
Pks
-
associated
protein
papA1
(
rv3824c
)
.

There
were
also
several
ppe
genes
that
seem
to
be
regulated
by
phoP
but
not
ppe68
[
21
]
.

In
addition
,
NirA
(
Rv2391
)
,
a
putative
nitrite
reductase
and
MmpL10
-
FadD21
(
Rv1183
-
85c
)
,
which
were
all
identified
by
TraSH
analysis
as
potentially
implicated
in
virulence
[
16
]
,
seem
to
be
regulated
by
PhoP
[
12
,
21
]
.

However
,
the
most
striking
link
in
relation
to
our
results
on
phoP
and
ESAT
-
6
secretion
that
was
revealed
by
these
two
transcriptional
analyses
,
were
the
data
on
gene
cluster
rv3612c
-
rv3616c
.

Closer
inspection
of
the
data
published
in
the
corresponding
supplemental
materials
showed
that
rv3612c
-
rv3616c
were
strongly
downregulated
in
the
H37Rv
phoP
ko
mutant
as
well
as
in
H37Ra
[
12
,
21
]
.

[
12
]
show
substantial
differences
between
cultures
grown
in
roller
bottles
relative
to
cultures
grown
in
shake
flasks
,
arguing
that
this
gene
cluster
might
be
regulated
by
environmental
conditions
through
the
PhoP
/
PhoR
system
.

However
,
upregulation
of
phoP
and
rv3614c
-
rv3616c
was
observed
after
incubation
of
M
.
tuberculosis
in
5mM
H2O2
[
37
]
.

Furthermore
,
rv3614c
-
rv3616c
were
reported
to
be
transiently
upregulated
in
the
phagosome
and
under
acidic
stress
[
38
]
.

Altogether
,
from
these
reports
it
seems
plausible
that
the
pleiotropic
regulator
PhoP
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
rv3612c
-
rv3616c
expression
and
thereby
influences
ESAT
-
6
secretion
and
virulence
[
16
]
,
but
to
unambiguously
answer
this
question
,
virulence
tests
with
recombinant
H37Ra
and
/
or
phoP
ko
strains
that
express
rv3616c
-
3612c
under
a
constitutive
promoter
or
a
tetracycline
inducable
expression
system
[
39
]
will
be
needed
.

As
in
previous
DNA
/
DNA
microarray
analyses
[
10
]
,
and
from
inspection
of
the
very
recently
released
genome
sequence
of
H37Ra
,
no
significant
differences
in
the
ESX
-
1
encoding
region
were
found
,
the
assumption
that
the
observed
lack
of
ESAT
-
6
secretion
in
H37Ra
may
be
caused
by
factors
outside
of
the
RD1
region
is
very
plausible
.

However
,
it
is
also
possible
that
the
observed
differences
may
be
caused
by
variations
of
in
vitro
culture
conditions
.

In
conclusion
,
in
this
work
we
report
the
identification
and
profound
consequences
of
the
PhoP
S219L
mutation
on
the
widely
used
H37Ra
strain
.

BLASTP
comparisons
of
the
PhoP
sequence
showed
that
the
predicted
DNA
binding
region
,
where
the
mutation
occurred
,
is
perfectly
conserved
among
a
wide
range
of
actinobacteria
,
with
H37Ra
being
the
only
strain
showing
such
a
mutation
.

It
should
be
mentioned
here
that
the
SO2
phoP
ko
strain
,
which
showed
strong
ESAT
-
6
expression
but
little
ESAT
-
6
secretion
(
Figure
5
)
,
induced
only
very
reduced
ESAT
-
6
-
specific
T
cell
responses
(
Figure

)
.

Comparative
analysis
of
the
Photorhabdus
luminescens
and
the
Yersinia
enterocolitica
genomes
:
uncovering
candidate
genes
involved
in
insect
pathogenicity

P
.
luminescens
lives
in
symbiosis
with
soil
nematodes
and
is
highly
pathogenic
towards
insects
but
not
to
humans
.

Results
A
selective
genome
comparison
was
applied
.

Proteins
belonging
to
the
class
of
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
,
quorum
sensing
,
universal
stress
proteins
,
and
c
-
di
-
GMP
signalling
have
been
analysed
.

The
interorganismic
synopsis
of
selected
regulatory
systems
uncovered
common
and
distinct
signalling
mechanisms
of
both
pathogens
used
for
perception
of
signals
within
the
insect
host
.

Particularly
,
a
new
class
of
LuxR
-
like
regulators
was
identified
,
which
might
be
involved
in
detecting
insect
-
specific
molecules
.

Our
analysis
also
highlights
factors
of
both
pathogens
that
are
expressed
at
low
temperatures
as
encountered
in
insects
in
contrast
to
higher
(
body
)
temperature
,
providing
evidence
that
temperature
is
a
yet
under
-
investigated
environmental
signal
for
bacterial
adaptation
to
various
hosts
.

Background

We
therefore
decided
to
perform
a
comparative
study
of
the
genomes
of
Photorhabdus
luminescens
and
Yersinia
enterocolitica
.

However
,
Y
.
pestis
,
a
blood
-
borne
pathogen
and
the
etiological
agent
of
human
plague
,
has
long
been
known
to
be
transmitted
by
insects
,
specifically
by
rat
fleas
.

More
recent
data
strongly
support
the
idea
that
yersiniae
are
capable
to
interact
with
insects
.

Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
,
in
contrast
to
Y
.
pestis
,
has
been
shown
to
be
orally
toxic
to
flea
[
8
]
.

While
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
have
diverged
within
the
last
200
million
years
,
Y
.
pestis
has
emerged
from
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
only
1
,
500
-
20
,
000
years
ago
[
9
]
.

Interestingly
,
another
Photorhabdus
species
,
P
.
asymbiotica
,
has
been
described
as
a
human
pathogen
.

It
is
assumed
that
these
strains
are
associated
with
spiders
,
because
spider
bites
where
attended
with
Photorhabdus
human
infections
[
15
]
.

Upon
entering
an
insect
host
,
the
nematodes
release
the
bacteria
by
regurgiation
directly
into
the
insect
hemocoel
,
the
open
circulatory
system
of
the
insect
.

Bioconversion
of
the
insect
'
s
body
by
P
.
luminescens
produces
a
rich
food
source
for
the
bacteria
as
well
as
for
the
nematodes
.

Nematode
reproduction
is
supported
by
the
bacteria
,
probably
by
providing
essential
nutrients
that
are
required
for
efficient
nematode
proliferation
[
16
]
.

When
the
insect
cadaver
is
depleted
,
the
nematodes
and
bacteria
reassociate
and
emerge
from
the
carcass
in
search
of
a
new
insect
host
(
Fig
.
1
,
right
circle
)
[
17
,
18
]
.

Primary
variants
are
found
to
produce
extracellular
protease
,
extracellular
lipase
,
intracellular
protein
crystals
CipA
and
CipB
,
antibiotics
,
and
are
bioluminescent
.

Secondary
variants
lack
protease
,
lipase
and
antibiotic
activity
,
and
bioluminescence
is
strongly
decreased
.

We
identified
genes
and
the
corresponding
proteins
involved
in
signalling
,
regulation
,
pathogenicity
,
as
well
as
in
metabolism
,
and
suggest
their
possible
function
during
colonization
and
infection
of
non
-
mammals
.

Results
and
Discussion

The
genome
of
the
latter
strain
has
a
size
of
~
4
.
6
Mbp
and
encodes
4037
putative
proteins
[
23
]
.

Two
-
component
signal
transduction
To
sense
their
environment
and
to
react
rapidly
to
changing
surrounding
conditions
,
bacteria
have
evolved
so
called
two
-
component
systems
(
TCSs
)
[
25
]
which
have
been
found
to
be
involved
in
the
control
of
virulence
or
symbiosis
,
in
metabolite
utilization
,
and
also
in
the
adaptation
to
various
stress
factors
[
26
]
.

The
consisting
domains
or
proteins
can
also
be
organized
as
more
complex
systems
using
a
His
-
Asp
-
His
-
Asp
phosphorelay
.

The
number
of
TCSs
ranges
from
zero
in
Mycoplasma
genitalium
to
80
in
Syncheocystes
spp
.

[
25
,
27
]
.

Eighteen
of
these
TCSs
are
present
in
P
.
luminescens
,
and
28
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
of
which
17
are
shared
by
both
organisms
(
Fig
.
2
,
depicted
in
grey
)
.

Among
the
eleven
TCSs
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
not
shared
by
P
.
luminescens
are
duplicates
of
the
CitA
/
CitB
system
(
YE2505
/
YE2506
and
YE2654
/
YE2655
)
and
of
the
LytS
/
LytR
system
(
YE1228
/
YE1227
and
YE4014
/
YE4015
)
.

Both
sensor
kinases
Plu0102
and
YE4185
are
of
moderate
similarity
(
31
.
5
%
identity
,
48
.
5
%
homology
)
.

Therefore
,
Plu0102
and
YE4185
are
interesting
candidates
for
unravelling
invertebrate
-
specific
signals
.

The
putative
target
genes
of
Plu0102
/
Plu0103
and
Ye4185
/
Ye4186
,
plu0104
and
ye4187
,
respectively
,
are
homologues
and
encode
putative
secreted
proteins
which
might
act
in
a
similar
,
yet
unknown
manner
.

All
TCSs
present
in
both
organisms
are
depicted
in
grey
in
Fig
.

2
,
and
include
PhoP
/
PhoQ
,
and
AstS
/
AstR
(
BvgS
/
BvgR
)
which
have
been
identified
to
be
involved
in
virulence
[
28
]
.

BvgS
/
BvgR
is
the
TCS
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
that
corresponds
to
AstS
/
AstR
.

It
has
recently
been
found
that
the
Kdp
-
system
of
P
.
luminescens
is
important
for
insect
pathogenicity
(
S
.
E
.
Reynolds
and
N
.
R
.
Waterfield
,
University
of
Bath
,
UK
,
personal
communication
)
.

Therefore
,
the
KdpD
/
KdpE
system
is
also
a
further
candidate
system
which
might
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
insecticidal
activity
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

The
only
TCS
of
P
.
luminescens
absent
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
is
TctE
/
TctD
(
Fig
.
2
,
marked
in
blue
)
,
which
,
however
,
is
found
in
the
genomes
of
Y
.
intermedia
and
Y
.
frederiksenii
.

Beside
these
microorganisms
,
TctE
/
TctD
homologues
controlling
the
transport
of
tricarboxylic
acid
(
see
section
"
Tricarboxylate
utilization
"
)
are
present
in
the
genera
Salmonella
,
Burkholderia
,
Agrobacterium
,
Bordetella
,
Collinsella
,
Xylella
,
Xanthomonas
,
and
Pseudomonas
,
particularly
P
.
entomophila
,
all
of
which
are
found
in
association
with
eukaryotes
.

In
comparison
to
P
.
luminescens
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
uses
an
expanded
set
of
TCSs
,
possibly
to
adapt
to
its
various
hosts
(
Fig
.

)
.

Regulation
by
AHL
-
LuxR
-
like
receptors
Virulence
,
bioluminescence
,
mutualism
,
antibiotic
production
and
biofilm
formation
are
often
regulated
by
LuxI
/
LuxR
quorum
sensing
systems
in
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
.

These
AHLs
are
produced
by
an
autoinductor
synthase
named
LuxI
.

Upon
autoinductor
-
binding
,
the
receptor
LuxR
binds
to
the
promoter
/
operator
regions
of
the
target
genes
or
operons
,
resulting
in
the
regulation
of
gene
expression
in
response
to
the
cell
number
[
33
]
.

Y
.
enterocolitica
possesses
a
typical
quorum
sensing
pair
of
homologues
,
YenI
/
YenR
(
YE1600
/
YE1599
)
,
and
it
has
recently
been
shown
that
swimming
and
swarming
motility
is
regulated
by
3
-
oxo
-
C6
-
AHL
and
C6
-
AHL
,
which
are
synthesized
by
YenI
[
34
]
.

In
the
genome
of
P
.
luminescens
,
two
genes
encoding
putative
AHL
-
LuxR
-
like
receptors
,
plu0320
and
plu4562
,
but
no
luxI
genes
are
present
(
Fig
.
3
)
.

A
similar
function
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
might
be
provided
by
YE1026
.

Instead
of
producing
AHLs
to
regulate
quorum
dependent
genes
,
a
common
strategy
of
insect
-
colonizing
bacteria
might
be
the
detection
of
AHLs
as
a
signal
for
the
presence
of
other
bacteria
such
as
those
colonizing
the
insect
intestinal
tract
or
living
in
soil
.

It
has
been
shown
that
the
luxS
pathway
negatively
controls
the
expression
of
genes
for
carbapenem
antibiotic
biosynthesis
in
P
.
luminescens
[
41
]
.

Homologues
of
these
proteins
are
present
in
Y

enterocolitica
(

)
,
suggesting
their
possible

in
this

Taken

a

for
the

of

,
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Regulation
by
PAS
_
4
/
LuxR
-
like
receptors

In
P
.
luminescens
,
the
amount
of
luxR
-
like
genes
is
overrepresented
with
39
copies
in
the
genome
.

Most
of
the
genes
are
located
in
two
large
gene
clusters
(
plu0918
-
0925
and
plu2001
-
2019
)
.

Interestingly
,
eleven
of
those
LuxR
-
like
receptors
are
present
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
of
which
five
are
located
in
a
cluster
(
ye0035
-
0039
)
.

PAS
-
domains
have
been
suspected
to
act
as
insect
juvenile
hormone
(
JH
)
receptors
in
the
fruit
fly
Drosophila
melanogaster
[
43
,
44
]
.

Met
has
been
shown
to
bind
JH
at
physiological
concentrations
and
is
therefore
suspected
to
act
as
a
JH
receptor
[
46
,
47
]
.

Therefore
,
the
potential
PAS
_
4
/
LuxR
-
like
receptors
of
P
.
luminescens
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
and
S
.
glossinidius
might
sense
JH
or
other
eukaryotic
hormones
of
the
insect
to
adapt
their
gene
expression
to
the
insect
host
.

The
high
number
of
35
highly
homologous
receptor
proteins
in
P
.
luminescens
might
be
the
reason
for
the
wide
insect
host
spectrum
this
pathogen
is
capable
to
infect
.

Although
Y
.
enterocolitica
protein
extracts
confer
toxicity
against
M
.
sexta
larvae
[
7
]
,
its
host
spectrum
still
remains
to
be
defined
.

LuxR
-
like
receptors
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
with
a
yet
unidentified
signalling
binding
-
site
are
YE2705
and
YE3014
,
both
of
which
are
also
present
in
Y
.
pestis
(
YPO2955
and
YPO2593
)
and
in
S
.
glossinidius
(
SGP1
_
007
,
SG1174
,
SG1480
,
and
SG1698
)
,
but
not
in
P
.
luminescens
(
Fig
.
3
)
.

It
might
be
possible
that
signalling
molecules
of
mammals
and
hormones
of
adult
insects
are
sensed
via
these
receptors
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
S
.
glossinidius
,
respectively
,
hosts
which
P
.
luminescens
does
not
specifically
interact
with
during
its
life
cycle
.

In
P
.
luminescens
,
two
LuxR
-
like
receptors
with
a
yet
unidentified
signalling
binding
site
are
present
,
Plu4274
and
Plu1817
,
the
latter
of
which
is
shared
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
(
YE1621
)
,
but
not
by
S
.
glossinidius
.

In
contrast
,
the
UspA
and
the
UspE
homologues
of
P
.
luminescens
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
are
nearly
similar
,
indicating
that
an
identical
stress
response
is
regulated
by
these
proteins
.

Homologues
of
these
proteins
are
also
present
in
P
.
aeruginosa
,
namely
PA4352
and
PA3309
,
a
tandem
-
type
Usp
protein
and
a
UspA
-
like
protein
,
respectively
.

They
are
essential
for
survival
under
anaerobic
growth
and
therefore
biofilm
formation
,
a
situation
cells
are
exposed
to
when
colonizing
the
cystic
fibrosis
lung
in
hosts
[
49
,
50
]
.

In
P
.
luminescens
,
expression
of
UspA
has
been
shown
to
be
under
control
of
the
AstS
/
AstR
TCS
,
which
is
important
for
the
correct
timing
of
phase
variant
switching
[
28
]
.

It
is
discussed
that
the
AstS
/
AstR
-
system
prevents
or
delays
phenotypic
variation
by
protecting
the
cell
from
stress
[
18
]
.

Because
Y
.
enterocolitica
produces
the
corresponding
TCS
BvgS
/
BvgR
,
but
is
not
known
to
switch
to
another
phenotypic
variant
,
the
possible
role
of
UspA
in
global
regulation
still
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Phenotypic
variation
and
thus
the
switch
between
mutualism
and
pathogenicity
in
P
.
luminescens
is
proposed
to
be
regulated
by
a
Ner
-
like
and
a
HexA
-
like
regulator
that
repress
primary
variant
specific
genes
in
the
stage
of
the
secondary
variant
[
17
]
.

In
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
the
transcriptional
repressor
RovM
(
YE1343
)
is
similar
to
HexA
of
P
.
luminescens
(
61
%
identity
and
75
%
homology
)
,
and
has
only
recently
been
shown
to
control
cell
invasion
,
virulence
and
motility
in
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
,
Y
.
pestis
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
[
51
-
53
]
.

P
.
luminescens
,
but
not
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
produces
two
members
of
the
UspFG
family
,
the
UspG
homologues
Plu2030
and
Plu2032
(
Tab
.
2
)
,
indicating
a
global
stress
response
induced
by
those
Usp
proteins
that
is
different
in
both
organisms
.

A
GroEL
homologue
is
present
in
P
.
luminescens
(
Plu4134
)
which
the
P
.
luminescens
UspG
homologues
might
interact
with
.

The
UspA
and
the
UspE
homologues
are
predicted
here
to
be
relevant
for
insect
infection
,
whereas
UspC
is
assumed
be
more
important
for
Y
.
enterocolitica
in
other
environments
/
hosts
.

The
two
UspG
homologues
might
constitute
a
set
of
Usp
proteins
that
play
a
specific
role
in
P
.
luminescens
infection
or
in
symbiosis
with
the
nematode
host
.

Cyclic
diguanylate
(
c
-
di
-
GMP
)
is
a
bacterial
second
messenger
that
activates
biofilm
formation
while
inhibiting
motility
,
thus
regulating
the
switch
between
a
planktonic
and
a
sessile
lifestyle
.

Proteins
containing
a
so
-
called
GGDEF
domain
are
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
,
and
those
with
a
so
-
called
EAL
domain
for
its
degradation
.

The
expression
and
activity
of
those
GGDEF
and
EAL
domain
containing
proteins
is
regulated
by
factors
with
a
PilZ
domain
that
binds
c
-
di
-
GMP
.

The
PilZ
domain
is
found
as
a
stand
-
alone
domain
or
in
combination
with
GGDEF
,
EAL
and
other
domains
,
thus
assumed
to
function
also
as
an
allosteric
domain
to
control
other
regulatory
enzymes
[
58
,
59
]
.

Eleven
of
these
proteins
solely
contain
a
GGDEF
-
domain
and
six
solely
an
EAL
-
domain
,
and
both
domains
are
found
in
tandem
in
five
proteins
.

The
protein
AdrA
(
YE3010
,
GGDEF
domain
)
is
annotated
as
a
putative
diguanylate
cyclase
,
YE2278
(
GGDEF
+
EAL
)
as
a
putative
phosphodiesterase
,
YE3818
(
GGDEF
)
as
a
putative
regulator
,
and
YE3806
(
GGDEF
+
EAL
)
as
a
putative
exported
protein
.

Furthermore
,
two
proteins
with
PilZ
domain
exist
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
namely
YE3197
and
BcsA
(
YE4074
)
,
a
putative
cellulose
synthase
.

Cellulose
synthesis
in
bacteria
has
been
identified
to
be
important
for
the
protection
from
chemical
or
mechanical
stress
by
forming
a
hydrophobic
extracellular
matrix
[
60
]
.

This
phenomenon
is
quite
surprising
,
because
with
few
exceptions
such
as
Helicobacter
pylori
,
nearly
all
pathogenic
bacteria
use
c
-
di
-
GMP
as
a
second
messenger
.

Virulence
factors

We
compared
both
genomes
with
respect
to
genes
encoding
toxins
,
adhesins
or
invasines
that
are
common
to
both
pathogens
.

All
virulence
factors
described
in
the
following
are
summarized
in
Fig
.

The
respective
genes
encoding
four
high
molecular
weight
toxin
complexes
are
termed
tca
,
tcb
,
tcc
and
tcd
.

Further
experiments
supported
the
hypothesis
that
TccC
-
like
proteins
might
act
as
universal
activators
of
,
or
chaperons
for
,
different
toxin
proteins
,
while
Tca
-
like
and
Tcd
-
like
proteins
contribute
predominantly
to
the
oral
toxicity
of
bacterial
supernatants
[
17
]
.

In
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
the
insecticidal
toxin
genes
are
located
on
a
distinct
genomic
island
termed
tc
-
PAIYe
of
21
kb
,
and
are
low
-
temperature
induced
[
7
]
.

Similar
islands
in
which
regulatory
genes
are
followed
by
three
tca
genes
,
phage
-
related
genes
and
one
or
two
tccC
genes
,
are
present
in
the
genomes
of
Y
.
pseudotuberculosis
IP32953
and
Y
.
pestis
KIM
.

The
reason
for
the
over
-
represence
of
tc
-
like
genes
in
the
P
.
luminescens
genome
might
reflect
the
different
strategies
followed
by
both
bacteria
within
insects
,
namely
the
rapid
killing
for
exploiting
the
victim
as
a
food
source
in
case
of
P
.
luminescens
,
and
infection
of
and
persistance
within
the
invertebrate
host
as
possibly
preferred
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Hemolysins
or
surface
-
associated
adhesins
,
together
with
their
transporters
,
are
sometimes
organized
as
two
-
partner
secretion
(
TPS
)
systems
,
a
specialized
mechanism
for
the
delivery
of
large
exoproteins
[
65
]
.

Eight
other
TPS
systems
are
present
in
P
.
luminescens
,
namely
Plu0225
/
Plu0226
,
Plu0548
/
Plu0549
,
Plu1149
/
Plu1150
,
Plu1367

Plu1368

Plu3064

Plu3125

3127
/
3128
,
Plu3667
/
Plu3668
,
and
Plu3718
/
Plu3719
,
and
further
three
genes
for
which
the
partner
locus
has
not
been
identified
(
Fig
.
4
)
.

FhaC
which
belongs
to
a
family
of
hemolysin
activator
proteins
related
to
ShlA
from
Serratia
marcescens
is
present
in
both
pathogens
and
also
induced
at
low
temperature
[
67
]
.

The
genome
sequence
of
P
.
luminescens
exhibits
more
toxin
genes
than
found
in
any
other
bacterial
genome
sequenced
yet
,
including
the
genome
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

A
putative
RTX
-
family
toxin
transporter
is
common
to
both
pathogens
(
YE1998
-
2000
,
Plu0634
/
Plu0635
)
.

The
P
.
luminescens
genome
comprises
a
gene
cluster
encoding
RTX
proteins
,
namely
plu1330
-
1369
.

P
.
luminescens
produces
a
series
of
proteins
similar
to
toxins
that
have
been
identified
in
other
bacteria
,
but
are
absent
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Most
of
these
toxins
probably
contribute
to
the
higher
insect
toxicity
of
P
.
luminescens
against
the
tobacco
hornworm
in
comparison
with
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

No
homologues
of
the
Y
.
pestis
gene
coding
for
enhancin
(
YPO0339
)
could
be
found
for
which
a
role
in
flea
colonization
was
predicted
[
74
]
.

Toxins
only
present
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
are
assumed
to
play
a
major
role
in
its
pathogenicity
towards
mammalians
,
and
some
of
them
might
have
been
acquired
by
horizontal
gene
transfer
.

Adhesins
and
invasins

Further
invasin
genes
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
with
counterparts
in
P
.
luminescens
are
ysaV
(
ye3546
/
plu3761
)
and
invF
(
ye3549
/
plu3775
)
.

Unique
for
the
human
pathogen
in
comparison
to
P
.
luminescens
are
the
two
fimbrial
gene
cluster
ye2664
-
2668
and
ye2692
-
2700
,
both
of
yet
hypothetical
function
.

Thus
,
invasin
and
adhesin
homologues
similar
in
the
two
pathogens
might
contribute
to
the
infection
of
insect
or
mammalian
hosts
,
but
candidates
for
insect
-
and
mammalian
-
specific
colonization
factors
have
also
been
revealed
by
the
genome
comparison
performed
here
.

Defensive
mechanisms

Interestingly
,
none
of
these
genes
showed
significant
similarities
to
sequences
of
the
Y
.
enterocolitica
genome
.

More
than
twenty
colicin
/
pyocin
-
like
factors
and
putative
immunity
proteins
are
unique
to
P
.
luminescens
in
comparison
to
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

P
.
luminescens
produces
proteins
similar
to
monooxygenases
,
dioxygenases
and
hydroxylases
that
have
been
suggested
to
play
a
role
in
rapid
elimination
of
insect
polyphenols
or
in
the
detoxification
of
reactive
oxygen
species
generated
by
the
invaded
host
[
24
]
.

Examples
are
the
product
of
plu4258
,
adjacent
to
a
gene
encoding
glutathione
transferase
(
plu4259
)
,
a
putative
steroid
monooxygenase
(
Plu4232
)
,
and
a
glycine
oxidase
(
Plu2242
)
,
all
of
which
have
no
counterparts
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Factors
present
in
both
pathogens
are
two
monooxigenases
encoded
by
ye1945
/
hpaC
(
plu0974
)
and
ye3394
/
plu3599
,
and
two
hydroxylases
encoded
by
ubiH
(
ye3395
/
plu3600
)
and
ubiF
(
ye2984
/
plu1313
)
.

Secretion
and
exoenzymes

In
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
two
type
-
III
secretion
systems
(
T3SS
)
essential
for
virulence
in
the
mammalian
host
are
encoded
on
pYV
and
by
the
ysa
operon
(
YE3533
-
3561
)
[
23
,
82
]
.

The
P
.
luminescens
genome
encodes
one
T3SS
which
is
highly
similar
to
the
plasmid
-
encoded
T3SS
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
probably
involved
in
the
secretion
of
virulence
proteins
or
in
immunomodulation
of
the
insect
response
to
an
infection
.

Interestingly
,
the
T3SS
of
Y
.
pestis
has
recently
been
demonstrated
to
translocate
insecticidal
toxins
,
providing
evidence
that
they
support
the
transmission
of
the
plague
agent
by
insects
[
83
]
.

The
P
.
luminescens
Lop
effector
proteins
are
homologs
of
the
Yop
effector
proteins
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
[
85
]
.

The
LopT
effector
protein
of
P
.
luminescens
can
be
injected
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
into
mammal
cells
[
86
]
,
underlining
the
idea
that
both
T3SS
act
similarly
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
homologues
of
the
Y
.
enterocolitica
low
-
calcium
-
response
genes
(
lcrH
,
lcrV
,
and
lrcD
)
in
P
.
luminescens
(
plu3757
,
plu3758
,
sctV
)
which
further
supports
this
hypothesis
.

These
are
substrate
-
specific
secretion
machineries
that
share
a
similar
architecture
and
secretion
mechanism
[
88
]
.

Proteins
secreted
by
these
systems
are
mainly
virulence
determinants
such
as
exotoxins
like
the
Cholera
toxin
of
Vibrio
cholerae
,
pili
,
and
S
-
layer
components
(
see
[
89
]
for
review
)
.

The
genes
encoding
these
kinds
of
secretion
systems
were
named
vas
(
virulence
associated
secretion
)
,
and
homologues
are
widespread
in
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
.

YplA
contributes
to
pathogenesis
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
in
a
mouse
model
[
94
]
,
suggesting
a
role
in
virulence
against
insects
for
the
P
.
luminescens
homologue
.

Two
additional
phospholipases
are
present
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
namely
PdlA
(
YE0203
)
and
PdlB
(
YE0207
)
,
the
latter
one
a
homologue
of
Plu4619
.

This
overlap
is
another
example
for
Y
.
enterocolitica
enzymes
probably
involved
rather
in
the
association
with
invertebrates
than
in
pathogenicity
towards
mammalians
.

Plu1971
of
P
.
luminescens
is
a
protein
which
contains
two
phospholipase
D
motifs
.

Furthermore
,
it
shares
homologies
to
the
plasmid
(
pMT1
)
-
encoded
murine

(
Ymt
)
of
Y
.
pestis
.

Due
to
its
absence
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
Ymt
is
another
example
for
the
high
diversity
of
genetic
determinants
that
are
used
by
closely
related
bacterial
pathogens
to
interact
with
their
insect
hosts
.

Examples
are
the
ten
triacylglycerol
lipases
of
P
.
luminescens
or
the
three
identified
lipases
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

Further
examples
for
shared
proteases
are
another
Zn
-
dependent
protease
(
Plu0306
/
YE4066
)
,
the
protease
III
(
Plu0631
/
YE3311
)
,
and
DegQ
/
DegS
(
YE3744
/
YE3745
/
Plu4018
/
Plu4022
)
.

We
also
identified
two
proteases
in
each
pathogen
(
Plu4291
,
Plu0631
,
YE0320
,
and
YE2087
)
without
a
homologue
in
the
other
bacterium
.

We
speculate
that
these
Y
.
enterocolitica
proteases
could
be
involved
in
the
infection
process
in
mammals
,
whereas
the
P
.
luminescens
proteases
are
rather
used
for
nutrient
bioconversion
than
for
the
infection
process
.

The
synthesis
of
vitamin
B12
that
occurs
only
anaerobically
is
required
for
the
degradation
of
1
,
2
-
propanediol
by
the
products
of
the
pdu
operon
,
as
well
as
of
ethanolamine
by
the
eutABC
-
encoded
enzymes
.

Y
.
enterocolitica
carries
the
genes
encoding
tetrathionate
reductase
(
ttrABC
)
and
the
TCS
TtrRS
(
YE1613
-
1617
)
.

The
gene
clusters
for
cobalamin
synthesis
and
propanediol
degradation
are
located
on
a
40
-
kb
genomic
island
(
ye2707
-
2750
)
,
but
the
eutABC
operon
is
missing
.

Propanediol
degradation
by
Y
.
enterocolitica
might
also
be
supported
by
YE4187
with
a
putative
GlcG
domain
which
is
predicted
to
be
involved
in
glycolate
and
propanediol
utilization
.

Further
metabolic
genes
common
to
both
pathogens
are
dctA
responsible
for
transport
of
C4
-
dicarboxylates
across
the
membrane
,
the
UhpABC
regulatory
system
controlling
the
hexose
phosphate
transport
by
UhpT
,
and
the
three
Mg2
+
transport
systems
CorA
,
MgtA
and
MgtB
.

Furthermore
,
both
insecticidal
bacteria
produce
a
chitin
-
binding
-
like
protein
(
Plu2352
,
YE3576
)
,
but
chitinase
-
like
proteins
(
Plu2235
,
Plu2458
and
Plu2461
)
are
without
homologues
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

The
proteins
encoded
by
the
P
.
luminescens
fecIRABCDE
operon
are
similar
to
the
components
of
the
E
.
coli
Fe3
+
-
dicitrate
transport
system
.

In
addition
,
Y
.
enterocolitica
produces
two
heme
-
protein
acquisition
sytems
(
YE0123
-
126
,
YE2180
-
2182
)
,
a
second
SfuABC
system
,
the
ferrichrome
binding
and
transport
proteins
(
YE0730
-
0732
)
,
a
putative
siderophore
(
YE0704
)
,
and
a
hemin
storage
system
(
YE2481
-
2484
)
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
photopexins
may
be
used
by
P
.
luminescens
to
scavenge
iron
containing
compounds
from
insects
[
105
]
.

It
also
indicates
that
iron
acquisition
is
a
prerequisite
for
the
infection
process
of
pathogenic
bacteria
not
only
in
mammalian
,
but
also
in
invertebrate
hosts
,
and
underlines
the
suggestion
that
genetic
determinants
of
invertebrate
pathogens
such
as
P
.
luminescens
include
the
progenitors
of
virulence
factors
against
vertebrates
[
79
,
106
]
.

The
TctE
/
TctD
system
is
the
only
TCS
of
P
.
luminescens
without
homologue
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
(
see
section
"
Two

,

)
.

The
Na
+
dependent
citrate
symporter
CitS
of
S
.
enterica
,
which
the
Y
.
enterocolitica
protein
YE2507
is
homologous
to
,
is
induced
by
the
CitA
/
CitB
system
for
fermentation
of
citrate
under
anoxic
conditions
[
110
]
,
indicating
a
general
difference
of
citrate
utilization
in
P
.
luminescens
and
Y
.
enterocolitica
.

While
Y
.
enterocolitica
explores
citrate
for
anaerobic
metabolism
,
it
is
most
likely
that
the
specific
uptake
of
citrate
and
other
tricarboxylic
acids
by
TctCBA
is
used
by
P
.
luminescens
upon
entering
the
insect
host
where
enough
citrate
is
available
.

The
specific
up
-
regulation
of
the
tricarboxylic
acid
cycle
(
TCA
)
enzymes
within
a
host
has
also
been
described
for
other
microorganisms
.

For
example
,
sucA
encoding
a
subunit
of
alpha
-
ketoglutarate
synthase
and
acnA
encoding
the
aconitase
have
been
found
to
be
induced
in
V
.
cholerae
during
host
infection
[
111
,
112
]
,
and
a
complete
TCA
cycle
is
also
required
for
S
.
typhimurium
virulence
[
113
]
.

Therefore
,
it
is
obvious
that
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
P
.
luminescens
use
different
sensing
and
utilization
strategies
for
tricarboxylates
.

Temperature
is
a
key
environmental
signal
to
enable
bacterial
adaptation
to
diverse
hosts
.

In
Yersinia
,
temperature
-
dependent
gene
expression
has
been
described
to
be
an
important
theme
in
bacterial
mechanisms
of
pathogenesis
towards
humans
[
116
]
.

The
data
have
derived
from
expression
profiling
in
vitro
and
cannot
directly
be
translated
to
the
in
vivo
situation
.

Recently
,
it
was
shown
that
the
flagellar
master
-
operon
of
X
.
nematophila
regulates
the
expression
of
a
novel
hemolysin
which
is
required
for
full
virulence
of
X
.
nematophila
against
insects
[
119
]
.

We
therefore
speculate
that
motility
essentially
contributes
to
the
control
of
the
Y
.
enterocolitica
switch
between
two
pathogenicity
phases
towards
mammalians
and
invertebrates
[
120
]
.

Evolution
of
pathogenicity

We
identified
several
common
loci
representing
ancestral
clusters
of
genes
important
in
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
P
.
luminescens
pathogenesis
that
might
have
evolved
during
the
association
of
bacteria
with
invertebrates
,
the
so
-
called
"
pre
-
vertebrate
"
pathosphere
[
121
]
and
then
been
adapted
to
more
recent
pathologies
in
mammalians
.

Examples
are
yersiniabactin
,
quorum
sensing
-
like
regulators
,
or
the
urease
operon
.

The
complexity
of
this
evolutionary
concept
is
also
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
immune
systems
both
of
invertebrates
and
vertebrates
are
based
on
phagocytic
cells
that
are
attacked
by
hemolysins
,
T3SS
effector
proteins
,
and
many
other
toxins
described
above
.

Thus
,
it
can
not
be
excluded
that
these
virulence
factors
are
able
to
act
on
both
immune
systems
[
121
]
.

Thus
,
P
.
asymbiotica
might
be
an
evolutionary
link
that
is
evolving
from
an
insect
to
a
mammal
-
pathogen
.

Another
example
that
might
enlighten
the
evolution
of
bacterial
pathogenicity
is
the
plasticity
zone
(
PZ
)
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
,
a
199
kb
key
locus
for
high
pathogenicity
that
includes
YAPIYe
,
secretion
systems
,
hydrogenase
loci
essential
for
gut
colonization
of
S
.
typhimurium
and
H
.
pylori
[
122
]
,
and
iron
acquisition
systems
.

It
is
assumed
that
the
PZ
has
not
been
acquired
by
a
single
event
of
gene
transfer
,
but
through
a
series
of
independent
insertions
[
23
]
.

A
region
highly
similar
to
YAPIYe
is
the
genome
island
plu0958
-
1166
carrying
a
hemolysin
,
hypothetical
genes
,
the
toxin
/
antitoxin
system
CcdA
/
CcdB
,
and
the
type
IV
pilus
.

Only
few
other
genes
or
operons
of
the
PZ
are
also
present
in
P
.
luminescens
,
namely
a
chitinase
,
two
iron
acquisition
systems
,
and
three
ysa
genes
,
thus
confirming
the
idea
of
a
patchwork
of
horizontally
acquired
genes
within
the
PZ
[
23
]
.

However
,
given
the
extensive
transfer
of
virulence
factors
between
bacteria
,
the
history
of
pathogen
evolution
still
requires
further
investigation
.

The
comparison
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
P
.
luminescens
at
the
genomic
level
performed
here
provides
the
database
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
genetic
basis
for
their
distinct
behaviour
towards
invertebrates
and
mammals
.

Y
.
enterocolitica
is
expected
to
switch
between
two
pathogenicity
phases
against
insects
and
mammalians
,
while
the
genome
of
P
.
luminescens
must
contain
the
modulators
and
regulators
necessary
to
change
the
bacterium
from
a
state
of
symbiosis
with
nematodes
to
pathogenicity
against
insects
,
and
also
from
symbiosis
-
proficient
primary
variants
to
symbiosis
-
deficient
secondary
variants
[
17
]
.

Those
adaptational
processes
must
be
precisely
regulated
by
the
bacteria
.

It
was
assumed
that
there
are
parallels
in
the
regulation
of
pathogenicity
in
mammals
and
insect
pathogens
[
41
,
123
]
.

However
,
molecular
components
of
the
regulatory
networks
controlling
pathogenicity
and
mutualism
have
recently
been
demonstrated
to
be
very
different
between
P
.
luminescens
and
X
.
nematophilus
with
similar
life
cycles
[
124
]
.

Dissecting
the
genomes
of
Y
.
enterocolitica
and
P
.
luminescens
for
putative
key
regulators
,
we
identified
factor
groups
(
AI
-
2
,
PAS
-
4
/
LuxR
like
receptors
)
possibly
involved
in
pathogen

insect
association
only
,
those
with
members
contributing
to
either
insect
or
mammalian
pathogenicity
(
QS
,
TKS
,
Usp
)
,
and
c
-
di
-
GMP
signalling
probably
not
involved
in
regulation
of
activities
against
insects
.

Certainly
,
the
question
whether
fundamental
differences
in
regulatory
networks
reflect
how
each
of
these
two
bacteria
specifically
interacts
with
either
the
insect
or
the
human
host
remains
to
be
addressed
in
more
detail
.

This
fact
might
explain
the
high
number
of
antibacterial
factors
directed
against
possible
competitors
that
are
going
to
colonize
the
same
insect
cadaver
or
that
are
already
present
in
the
insect
gut
flora
[
17
]
.

In
contrast
,
only
highly
concentrated
protein
extracts
of
Y

are
toxic
for
M

,
and
a

(

Up
to
the

are
far
away
from
understanding
the

The
GraRS

Results

impact
of

wild
type
and
its
isogenic
graRS
deletion
mutant
by
the
human
cathelicidin
LL
-

or
human
neutrophil
granulocytes
in

,
and
the
ability
to
cause
infection
in
vivo
.

Conclusion
Our
results
indicate
that
S
.
aureus
can
regulate
its
surface
properties
in
order
to
overcome
innate
host
defenses
.

Background

Staphylococcus
aureus
,
a
frequent
cause
of
human
infections
,
is
highly
resistant
to
antimicrobial
factors
of
the
innate
immune
system
such
as
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
(
CAMPs
)
[
1
,
2
]
which
are
produced
by
epithelial
cells
and
neutrophils
[
3
,
4
]
.

These
peptides
generally
contain
10
-
50
amino
acids
and
have
positive
net
charges
[
5
]
.

S
.
aureus
has
evolved
mechanisms
to
alter
the
anionic
charge
of
cell
surface
components
to
gain
resistance
to
a
broad
variety
of
cationic
antimicrobial
factors
such
as
CAMPs
[
7
]
,
phospholipase
A2
[
8
]
,
myeloperoxidase
[
9
]
,
or
lysozyme
[
10
]
.

A
similar
reaction
is
mediated
by
products
of
the
dltABCD
operon
,
which
are
responsible
for
attachment
of
positively
charged
D
-
alanine
residues
into
negatively
charged
phosphate
groups
in
the
backbone
of
teichoic
acids
[
7
,
9
]
.

In
a
S
.
aureus
SA113
graRS
deletion
mutant
,
the
content
of
D
-
alanine
in
teichoic
acids
was
reduced
by
47
%
and
the
mutant
showed
reduced
resistance
to
various
antibiotics
including
polymyxin
B
,
gallidermin
,
and
vancomycin
[
10
,
13
]
.

Accordingly
,
graRS
have
previously
been
implicated
in
regulation
of
vancomycin
intermediary
resistance
[
14
]
.

As
the
dlt
operon
plays
a
key
role
in
S
.
aureus
resistance
to
cationic
antimicrobial
host
molecules
,
the
graRS
system
may
be
important
in
evasion
of
host
defense
mechanisms
such
as
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
and
neutrophil
killing
.

Results

The
graRS
mutant
bound
significantly
more
cytochrome
c
than
the
WT
or
the
complemented
mutant
(
Fig
.
1A
)
,
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
recently
described
reduced
content
of
D
-
alanine
residues
in
the
teichoic
acids
of
the
mutant
[
10
]
.

Due
to
the
high
binding
capacities
of
the
dltA
and
the
dltA
/
graRS
mutant
we
modified
the
conditions
in
order
to
prevent
limitation
of
applied
cytochrome
c
.

Deletion
of
the
graRS
genes
in
the
dlt
mutant
background
did
not
lead
to
further
increased
binding
of
cytochrome
c
compared
to
the
dltA
mutant
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.

Increased
binding
of
cationic
proteins
may
also
result
from
reduced
mprF
expression
and
,
accordingly
,
reduced
lysylphosphatidylglycerol
(
LPG
)
content
.

The
amounts
of
LPG
from
WT
and
graRS
mutant
were
indistinguishable
(
data
not
shown
)
,
which
corroborates
recent
findings
that
mprF
is
not
among
the
graRS
-
regulated
genes
in
S
.
aureus
SA113
[
10
]
.

The
graRS
mutant
is
more
susceptible
to
killing
by
LL
-
37
and
human
neutrophil
granulocytes
in
vitro
In
an
attempt
to
test
whether
the
increased
affinity
of
the
graRS
mutant
to
cationic
molecules
leads
to
higher
susceptibility
to
human
host
defense
peptides
,
we
compared
inactivation
of
WT
and
graRS
mutant
by
the
human
cathelicidin
LL
-
37
.

Next
we
investigated
whether
the
graRS
mutant
is
killed
faster
than
the
parental
strain
by
human
neutrophils
,
which
produce
high
amounts
of
LL
-
37
and
other
CAMPs
as
components
of
their
antibacterial
killing
arsenal
.

The
graRS
mutant
was
killed
by
neutrophils
considerably
faster
than
the
WT
strain
.

Of
note
,
our
previous
studies
had
shown
that
altered
alanylation
of
teichoic
acids
does
not
affect
the
rate
of
PMN
phagocytosis
[
9
]
.

Taken
together
,
these
data
indicate
that
graRS
-
mediated
control
of
CAMP
resistance
mechanisms
is
of
importance
for
S
.
aureus
evasion
from
neutrophil
killing
.

Therefore
female
BALB
/
c
mice
(
12
to
15
weeks
old
)
were
infected
with
S
.
aureus
WT
or
graRS
mutant
bacteria
.

72
h
after
infection
numbers
of
CFU
/
kidney
were
determined
.

Significantly
less
bacteria
were
detected
in
the
kidneys
of
animals
,
which
had
been
infected
with
the
graRS
mutant
than
those
infected
with
the
WT
bacteria
.

production
of
a
pore
-
forming
toxin
streptolysin
O
(
SLO
)
and
due
to
impairment
of
PMN
migration
via
digesting
interleukin
-
8
,
a
PMN
attracting
chemokine
,
by
increased
production
of
a
serine
protease
ScpC
.

Expression
of
genes
was
upregulated
by
a
loss
of
repressive
function
with
the
mutation
of
csrS
gene
in
the
all
emm49
severe
invasive
GAS
isolates
.

However
,
GAS
which
lack
either
SLO
or
ScpC
exhibit
much
less
mortality
than
the
csrS
-
mutated
parent
invasive
GAS
isolate
to
the
infected
mice
.

Streptococcus
pyogenes
(
group
A
streptococcus
;
GAS
)
is
one
of
the
most
common
human
pathogens
.

Several
streptococcal
virulence
factors
,
including
streptolysin
,
and
M
protein
,
have
been
reported
to
be
involved
in
these
diseases
,
by
genetic
studies
or
animal
-
passaged
models
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
,
[
4
]
-
[
6
]
.

The
strains
of
emm1
genotype
,
among
more
than
100
emm
genes
encoding
the
serotype
-
determinant
M
protein
,
are
the
predominant
cause
of
severe
GAS
infections
in
Japan
[
7
]
.

Therefore
,
emm49
GAS
isolated
from
invasive
infections
seems
to
acquire
the
novel
or
altered
virulence
factors
by
mutations
,
genomic
additions
,
or
deletions
.

Epidemiological
and
pathological
findings
,
including
sporadic
incidents
of
severe
invasive
GAS
infections
[
9
]
,
high
frequency
of
severe
invasive
infections
in
immunocompromised
host
[
9
]
,
and
aggregation
of
bacteria
and
a
paucity
of
polymorphnuclear
neutrophils
(
PMN
)
in
foci
of
invasive
GAS
infection
[
10
]
suggest
that
host
defense
factors
play
an
important
role
in
the
onset
of
invasive
infections
.

However
,
restricted
availability
of
clinical
isolates
with
the
same
serotypes
fail
to
elucidate
direct
relationship
between
definitive
genetic
changes
in
clinically
isolated
severe
invasive
GAS
and
the
lack
of
PMN
at
the
site
of
bacterial
growth
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
explore
the
crucial
factors
in
the
pathogenesis
of
severe
invasive
GAS
infections
in
the
context
of
PMN
-
GAS
relationship
,
using
a
panel
of
emm49
clinical
isolates
from
patients
with
or
without
severe
invasive
infection
,
and
their
gene
-
manipulated
mutants
.

Group
A
streptococcus
isolates
from
severe
invasive
infections
is
resistant
to
killing
by
human
PMN
To
examine
whether
emm49
GAS
isolated
from
severe
invasive
infection
might
alter
human
PMN
function
,
we
performed
phagocytosis
assay
in
vitro
.

However
,
as
shown
in
Figure
1B
,
in
vitro
killing
assay
revealed
that
PMN
killed
non
-
invasive
GAS
,
resulting
in
15
-
42
%
of
initial
number
of
bacteria
,
but
not
invasive
GAS
(
p
=
0
.
019
)
.

The
similar
results
were
obtained
when
opsonized
with
either
FCS
or
human
serum
regardless
of
complements
immobilization
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Therefore
,
we
examined
whether
GAS
clinically
isolated
from
severe
invasive
infections
could
affect
the
migration
ability
of
PMN
in
response
to
chemokines
.

PMN
death
was
induced
shortly
after
encounter
with
severe
invasive
GAS
,
and
PMN
were
not
in
apoptotic
death
because
of
low
frequency
of
cells
positive
for
annexin
V
(
data
not
shown
)
,
which
was
seen
in
the
case
of
cytolysin
-
dependent
cell
injury
[
15
]
.

GAS
produce
two
cytolysins
that
may
contribute
to
pathogenesis
.

Therefore
,
to
know
the
mechanism
underlying
GAS
-
mediated
killing
of
PMN
,
we
investigated
whether
SLO
produced
by
invasive
GAS
affect
survival
of
PMN
in
an
in
vitro
migration
assay
system
.

Furthermore
,
an
SLO
deficient
mutant
from
a
STSS
isolate
NIH230
(
NIH230slo
)
lost
the
killing
activity
for
PMN
(
Figure
3A
)
,
thereby
,
strongly
suggesting
that
SLO
is
a
key
element
for
PMN
killing
mediated
by
invasive
GAS
.

Contrarily
,
SLS
-
deficient
mutant
from
NIH230
strain
(
NIH230sagA
)
killed
PMN
,
as
efficiently
as
did
parent
strain
,
indicating
that
SLS
is
dispensable
for
killing
of
PMN
mediated
by
invasive
GAS
.

SLO
and
SLS
double
mutant
GAS
from
NIH230
strain
(
NIH230slosagA
)
displayed
the
killing
activity
indistinguishable
from
that
of
NIH230slo
,
confirming
the
primarily
role
of
SLO
for
GAS
-
mediated
PMN
killing
.

Impaired
migration
of
PMN
is
due
to
degradation
of
IL
-
8
by
serine
proteinase
ScpC

Therefore
,
we
quantified
the
amount
of
IL
-
8
in
culture
before
and
after
co
-
culture
with
clinically
isolated
GAS
or
its
mutants
.

Figure
4B
shows
that
the
amount
of
IL
-
8
was
significantly
reduced
by
60
-
min
co
-
culture
with
NIH230
,
as
well
as
NIH230slo
,
but
not
with
non
-
invasive
GAS
1556
.

Enhanced
expression
of
the
slo
and
the
scpC
genes
in
severe
invasive
GAS
is
attributed
to
mutation
of
a
transcriptional
regulator
CsrS

Although
sequences
of
the
slo
gene
and
the
scpC
gene
were
identical
among
clinically
isolated
non
-
invasive
and
severe
invasive
GAS
(
data
not
shown
)
,
Figure
5A
shows
that
the
slo
and
the
scpC
genes
were
expressed
in
the
severe
invasive
GAS
greater
in
extent
than
those
in
the
non
-
invasive
GAS
.

The
expression
of
the
other
virulence
-
associated
genes
,
such
as
IgG
degrading
protease
of
GAS
,
Mac
-
1
-
like
protein
(
mac
)
,
nicotine
adenine
dinucleotide
glycohydrolase
(
nga
)
,
polysaccharide
capsule
production
(
hasA
)
,
and
C5a
peptidase
(
scpA
)
,
was
also
upregulted
in
the
severe
invasive
GAS
,
greater
than
that
detected
in
the
non
-
invasive
GAS
(
Figure
5A
)
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
prominent
changes
in
the
transcriptional
profile
of
several
virulence
-
associated
genes
,
including
the
slo
and
the
scpC
,
in
the
all
severe
invasive
GAS
.

Mutation
of
csrR
or
csrS
can
cause
significant
alterations
in
virulence
in
mouse
models
of
infection
,
either
increasing
lethality
or
the
severity
of
localized
soft
tissue
lesions
[
5
]
,
[
6
]
.

GAS
isolates
from
mice
with
severe
invasive
disease
had
mutations
in
csrS
,
raising
the
notion
that
CsrR
/
S
function
is
important
in
modulating
gene
expression
during
infection
.

Therefore
,
we
analyzed
the
linkage
between
the
csrS
and
/
or
csrR
genes
and
the
property
of
invasive
GAS
infection
by
sequencing
these
genes
in
the
emm49
strains
used
in
this
study
.

The
nucleotide
sequence
of
the
csrR
gene
was
identical
in
all
the
isolates
,
and
that
of
the
csrS
gene
was
identical
among
the
all
non
-
invasive
GAS
isolates
(
data
not
shown
)
.

The
csrS
-
introduced
severe
invasive
GAS
reduced
the
expression
levels
of
the
slo
and
the
scpC
genes
,
comparable
to
those
detected
in
the
non
-
invasive
GAS
.

In
parallel
with
the
expression
profile
of
slo
and
scpC
in
the
severe
invasive
GAS
,
introduction
of
the
intact
csrS
gene
into
the
severe
invasive
GAS
restored
the
susceptibility
to
the
killing
by
PMN
(
p
=
0
.
015
compared
with
severe
invasive
isolates
+
CsrS
)
(
Figure
6A
)
,
abrogated
the
inhibition
of
PMN
migration
by
degradation
of
IL
-
8
(
p
=
0
.
002
compared
with
invasive
isolates
+
CsrS
)
(
Figure
4A
,
4B
,
and
6B
)
,
and
diminished
the
killing
activity
for
PMN
by
necrosis
(
p
=
0
.
00016
compared
with
invasive
isolates
+
CsrS
)
(
Figure
3A
,
3C
,
and
6C
)
,
These
results
strongly
suggest
that
mutations
in
the
csrS
gene
correspond
to
the
immunocompromized
activity
in
the
severe
invasive
isolates
,
associated
with
inhibition
of
PMN
recruitment
and
survival
.

In
order
to
elucidate
the
role
of
csrS
,
in
infections
in
vivo
,
we
compared
the
virulence
of
GAS
isolates
using
a
mouse
model
which
infected
GAS
intraperitoneally
.

Consistently
,
an
introduction
of
the
intact
csrS
gene
into
the
NIH230
strain
(
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
)
reduced
the
LD50
value
to
the
level
observed
in
the
non
-
invasive
strain
.

These
results
indicate
that
csrS
is
an
important
virulence
factor
in
the
mouse
model
of
lethal
infections
.

As
shown
in
Figure
7A
,
the
NIH230
strain
caused
bacteremia
in
mice
24
h
after
intraperitoneal
injection
whereas
the
bacteremia
was
barely
detected
in
mice
infected
with
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
as
well
as
the
1566
strain
(
p
=
0
.
005
compared
with
non
-
invasive
isolates
,
and
p
=
0
.
005
compared
with
invasive
isolates
+
CsrS
)
.

Histopathologically
,
in
the
mice
injected
with
the
NIH230
strain
,
bacteria
formed
clusters
in
interstitial
tissues
in
the
kidneys
and
the
lungs
,
accompanied
congestion
and
no
inflammatory
cells
at
infectious
foci
(
Figure
7B
,
7C
and
data
not
shown
)
.

Contrarily
,
no
significant
pathological
alterations
were
observed
in
the
mice
injected
with
the
1566
and
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
strains
(
Figure
7B
and
7C
)
.

Figure
7D
shows
that
subcutaneous
infection
of
NIH230
formed
the
infected
lesions
with
area
significantly
larger
than
those
of
1566
and
NIH230
:
:
csrS
+
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
invasive
GAS
isolates
are
more
virulent
in
vivo
than
non
-
invasive
GAS
,
and
impair
PMN
function
in
vivo
,
owing
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
the
mutations
in
the
csrS
gene
.

Finally
,
we
assessed
the
influence
of
enhanced
expression
of
the
scpC
or
the
slo
gene
on
the
virulence
in
a
mouse
model
.

As
shown
in
Table
1
,
NIH230scpC
and
NIH230slo
exerted
the
LD50
value
3
-
10
fold
lower
than
that
of
the
non
-
invasive
isolate
1566
,
but
10
-
30
fold
higher
than
that
of
severe
invasive
isolates
.

These
results
suggest
that
enhanced
expression
of
ScpC
and
SLO
in
invasive
GAS
plays
an
important
role
in
vivo
virulence
of
GAS
infection
.

Introduction
of
the
intact
csrS
gene
into
the
severe
invasive
GAS
restored
the
susceptibility
to
the
killing
by
PMN
and
abrogated
the
activity
for
inhibition
of
PMN
recruitment
and
survival
,
thus
,
demonstrating
an
instructional
role
of
the
loss
-
of
-
functional
mutations
in
csrS
gene
for
the
evasion
of
PMN
functions
,
providing
unique
pathophysiology
of
invasive
GAS
infections
.

Then
we
further
examined
whether
severe
invasive
isolates
of
other
than
emm49
genotype
have
the
mutation
of
the
csrS
and
the
csrR
genes
.

The
frequency
of
the
mutation
in
the
csrS
gene
is
higher
than
that
in
csrR
(
csrS
mutation
:
csrR
mutation
=
59
:
19
)
(
manuscript
in
preparation
)
,
suggesting
the
csrS
mutation
is
more
important
in
comparison
with
that
of
csrR
in
the
clinical
isolates
regardless
of
emm
genotypes
.

This
dominant
role
of
CsrS
is
the
first
important
observation
in
this
study
,
and
its
mutation
is
possibly
more
important
than
that
of
csrR
in
terms
of
etiopathogenesis
of
human
severe
invasive
diseases
.

As
examples
,
SpeB
[
22
]
and
SLS
[
23
]
have
been
proposed
as
an
invasive
infection
-
associated
factor
by
its
cytotoxic
effect
,
however
,
speB
and
sagA
expression
is
not
enhanced
in
any
csrS
-
mutated
severe
invasive
GAS
isolate
used
in
this
study
and
others
[
5
]
,
[
24
]
.

Furthermore
,
SLS
hemolytic
activity
of
invasive
GAS
is
significantly
decreased
as
compared
with
non
-
invasive
strains
(
data
not
shown
)
and
SLS
-
deletion
in
invasive
GAS
did
not
affect
PMN
survival
at
all
,
excluding
the
possibility
for
the
role
of
SLS
in
PMN
necrosis
seen
in
this
study
.

However
,
we
confirmed
that
addition
of
DNase
in
the
culture
did
not
alter
the
level
of
PI
-
positive
PMN
,
meaning
bright
PI
staining
of
PMN
is
not
due
to
release
of
NETs
from
PMN
(
Figure
S1A
)
.

These
suggest
that
DNase
may
be
important
but
redundant
for
induction
of
invasive
diseases
.

Therefore
,
the
second
important
observation
in
the
present
study
is
that
an
essential
requirement
of
csrS
mutation
for
invasive
infection
is
associated
with
increased
expression
of
ScpC
and
SLO
and
in
vitro
evasion
of
PMN
functions
,
though
we
do
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
other
CsrS
-
regulating
factors
contribute
to
the
escape
of
invasive
GAS
from
host
defense
.

SLO
and
ScpC
independently
enable
GAS
to
escape
from
PMN
functions
;
Present
data
using
clinical
isolated
GAS
and
a
scpC
-
deletion
mutant
(
Figure
4A
and
4B
)
show
that
enhanced
production
of
serine
proteinase
ScpC
in
virulent
GAS
is
essential
to
impair
PMN
migration
in
vitro
by
degradation
of
IL
-
8
,
as
others
partially
have
demonstrated
[
17
]
-
[
19
]
.

The
present
study
also
uncovers
that
increased
activity
of
SLO
from
invasive
GAS
isolates
induces
rapid
and
extensive
necrosis
to
human
PMN
.

SLO
is
a
cholesterol
-
binding
pore
-
forming
hemolysin
as
well
as
cytotoxic
for
other
cells
[
15
]
.

A
study
has
demonstrated
SLO
from
invasive
GAS
lyse
PMN
[
27
]
,
however
this
effect
is
likely
due
to
complement
activation
by
SLO
[
28
]
or
PMN
activation
[
29
]
but
not
due
to
cytotoxity
of
SLO
itself
as
judged
by
their
flow
cytometry
profiles
which
are
distinct
from
ours
(
Figure
2A
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
observed
that
SLO
concentration
in
a
short
-
time
culture
with
severe
invasive
GAS
did
not
reach
the
threshold
level
to
kill
PMN
by
formation
of
pores
(
data
not
shown
)
and
that
PMN
did
not
undergo
necrosis
upon
incubation
with
culture
media
of
severe
invasive
GAS
(
Figure
3B
)
,
leading
to
the
novel
possibility
that
PMN
are
probably
killed
following
encounter
with
invasive
GAS
in
a
contact
-
dependent
manner
.

Collaboration
of
SLO
with
other
toxins
may
be
critical
to
induce
PMN
necrosis
as
similarly
mechanism
has
been
reported
[
31
]
,
although
it
remains
to
be
examined
whether
there
exist
explore
interaction
-
associated
molecules
on
both
host
and
bacterial
membrane
is
needed
.

In
contrast
to
the
previous
view
[
18
]
,
we
observed
that
both
of
ScpC
and
SLO
together
,
but
not
each
of
them
,
mediated
sufficient
in
vivo
virulence
(
Table
1
)
,
thus
compatible
with
the
notion
that
plural
virulence
-
associated
factors
under
the
regulation
of
csrS
abrogate
PMN
bactericidal
functions
and
induce
invasive
diseases
in
in
vivo
animal
model
.

Consistently
,
the
high
mortality
and
histopathological
findings
which
lacks
PMN
infiltration
in
mice
tissues
infected
with
csrS
-
mutated
GAS
(
Figure
7
)
are
similar
to
those
seen
in
clinical
invasive
GAS
infections
[
32
]
.

These
evidences
suggest
that
the
level
of
PMN
function
is
one
of
the
critical
factors
to
determine
the
threshold
for
the
onset
of
invasive
GAS
infection
,
which
may
be
the
reason
for
rare
outbreaks
of
invasive
GAS
infections
.

A
further
study
in
which
collates
clinical
with
bacterial
/
immunological
data
may
provide
with
novel
clues
for
early
diagnosis
and
therapeutics
of
invasive
bacterial
infections
.

Biofilms
are
surface
-
adhered
bacterial
communities
encased
in
an
extracellular
matrix
composed
of

To

,
extracellular
DNA
has
been
shown
to
function
as
a
structural
support
to
maintain
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
biofilm
architecture
.

Here
we
show
that
DNA
is
a
multifaceted
component
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
.

At
physiologically
relevant
concentrations
,
extracellular
DNA
has
antimicrobial
activity
,
causing
cell
lysis
by
chelating
cations
that
stabilize
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
and
the
outer
membrane
(
OM
)
.

DNA
-
mediated
killing
occurred
within
minutes
,
as
a
result
of
perturbation
of
both
the
outer
and
inner
membrane
(
IM
)
and
the
release
of
cytoplasmic
contents
,
including
genomic
DNA
.

Sub
-
inhibitory
concentrations
of
DNA
created
a
cation
-
limited
environment
that
resulted
in
induction
of
the
PhoPQ
-
and
PmrAB
-
regulated
cationic
antimicrobial
peptide
resistance
operon
PA3552
-
PA3559
in
P
.
aeruginosa
.

Furthermore
,
DNA
-
induced
expression
of
this
operon
resulted
in
up
to
2560
-
fold
increased
resistance
to
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
and
640
-
fold
increased
resistance
to
aminoglycosides
,
but
had
no
effect
on
beta

and
fluoroquinolone
resistance
.

The
biofilm
-
forming
ability
of
P
.
aeruginosa
,
and
indeed
other
bacteria
,
is
thought
to
contribute
to
their
ability
to
thrive
in
hostile
host
environments
and
result
in
chronic
infection
[

]
,
[

]
.

Biofilms
are
multicellular
surface
-
associated
microbial
communities
encased
in
an
extracellular
matrix
which
display
a
characteristic
structure
and
increased
resistance
to
antimicrobial
compounds
and
environmental
stresses
.

As
acute
CF
exacerbations
caused
by
P
.
aeruginosa
are
often
treated
with
combination
antibiotic
therapy
[
8
]
-
[
10
]
,
the
increased
resistance
of
biofilms
to
combination
antibiotics
is
of
direct
clinical
relevance
.

Eighty
five
percent
of
P
.
aeruginosa
strains
isolated
from
the
lungs
of
CF
patients
with
advanced
stages
of
disease
have
a
distinctive
mucoid
colony
morphology
[
11
]
.

This
mucoid
phenotype
is
a
result
of
overproduction
of
the
alginate
exopolysaccharide
(
EPS
)
[
1
]
,
[
12
]
.

The
direct
observation
of
P
.
aeruginosa
microcolonies
encased
in
an
alginate
matrix
in
microscopy
studies
of
CF
bronchial
samples
[
17
]
,
along
with
a
large
body
of
additional
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
data
[
7
]
,
[
18
]
-
[
21
]
suggests
that
P
.
aeruginosa
forms
biofilms
in
the
lungs
of
CF
patients
.

The
mechanisms
of
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
are
distinct
from
the
well
studied
intrinsic
resistance
mechanisms
such
as
drug
efflux
,
drug
inactivation
,
membrane
permeability
and
target
site
alterations
.

Although
the
basis
of
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
is
not
fully
understood
,
it
is
likely
that
multiple
mechanisms
operate
simultaneously
in
biofilms
to
contribute
to
antibiotic
resistance
.

It
is
the
general
consensus
that
reduced
diffusion
through
the
biofilm
matrix
only
provides
a
short
-
term
protective
effect
and
does
not
play
a
significant
role
during
long
-
term
antibiotic
exposure
[
26
]
.

Despite
the
fact
that
biofilms
are
recognized
as
the
predominant
mode
of
bacterial
growth
in
nature
and
are
responsible
for
the
majority
of
refractory
bacterial
infections
[
19
]
,
little
is
known
regarding
the
mechanisms
of
biofilm
-
specific
antibiotic
resistance
.

Signal
transduction
systems
have
been
documented
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
biofilm
formation
in
multiple
bacterial
species
including
P
.
aeruginosa
,
S
.
aureus
,
E
.
coli
and
V
.
fischeri
[
33
]
-
[
38
]
.

These
two
component
systems
(
TCS
)
are
comprised
of
an
membrane
-
anchored
histidine
kinase
sensor
and
a
cytoplasmic
response
regulator
.

Additionally
,
the
hybrid
sensor
kinases
,
LadS
and
RetS
appear
to
work
upstream
of
GacA
to
possibly
control
the
switch
to
a
biofilm
lifestyle
[
34
]
,
[
35
]
.

CAPs
are
short
,
amphipathic
peptides
that
bind
to
and
disrupt
both
the
outer
and
cytoplasmic
membranes
resulting
in
cell
death
.

The
broad
-
spectrum
antimicrobial
activity
of
CAPs
against
Gram
-
negative
and
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
accounts
for
their
role
as
an
essential
component
of
the
innate
immune
response
of
humans
,
animals
and
insects
.

Cationic
peptides
,
which
have
antimicrobial
and
immunomodulatory
activities
,
are
being
developed
as
a
promising
new
class
of
therapeutically
relevant
drugs
[
42
]
.

In
P
.
aeruginosa
,
resistance
to
CAPs
is
inducible
by
the
PhoPQ
and
PmrAB
TCSs
,
both
of
which
are
activated
independently
in
response
to
limiting
Mg2
+
[
43
]
-
[
46
]
.

Under
conditions
of
limiting
magnesium
,
PhoP
and
PmrA
bind
to
the
promoter
of
the
CAP
resistance
operon
PA3552
-
PA3559
(
arnBCADTEF
-
ugd
)
and
induce
its
expression
[
45
]
-
[
47
]
.

The
PhoPQ
and
PmrAB
regulatory
systems
are
well
studied
in
planktonic
cultures
and
have
been
shown
to
induce
modest
resistance
to
CAPs
(
8
-
fold
)
under
low
Mg2
+
conditions
[
45
]
.

However
,
while
the
PA3552
-
PA3559
operon
has
been
reported
to
be
expressed
in
biofilms
cultivated
in
flowcells
,
and
is
required
for
survival
in
response
to
colistin
treatment
[
49
]
,
little
else
is
known
regarding
these
systems
and
the
role
they
may
play
in
biofilm
-
associated
antibiotic
resistance
.

The
extracellular
matrix
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
includes
extracellular
DNA
[
50
]
,
[
51
]
,
multiple
bacterial
exopolysaccharides
and
host
proteins
[
4
]
,
[
52
]
.

It
has
been
reported
that
prophage
-
mediated
cell
death
is
an
important
mechanism
in
the
differentiation
and
dispersal
of
biofilms
[
54
]
,
[
55
]
.

In
this
study
we
sought
to
examine
if
the
presence
of
DNA
in
biofilms
may
contribute
to
biofilm
-
specific
antibiotic

Extracellular
DNA
induces
cell
death
by
membrane
perturbation
and
cell
lysis

DNA
is
a
highly
anionic
polymer
due
to
the
phosphates
in
the
deoxyribose
backbone
.

This
property
,
in
combination
with
the
fast
-
killing
observed
in
response
to
extracellular
DNA
led
us
to
hypothesize
that
addition
of
exogenous
DNA
resulted
in
the
loss
of
membrane
integrity
through
cation
chelation
,
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
observed
with
the
known
cation
chelator
EDTA
[
58
]
.

To
determine
the
effect
of
DNA
on
membrane
integrity
,
microscopic
analysis
in
response
to
lethal
concentrations
of
DNA
and
relevant
controls
was
performed
.

Lipoproteins
are
lipid
-
modified
proteins
anchored
in
the
outer
leaflet
of
the
IM
or
the
inner
leaflet
of
the
OM
.

P

cells
producing
mCherry
fluorescent

lipoproteins
(
lipoChFP
)
that
are
localized
to
either
the
OM
or
IM
[
60
]
,
[

]
were
used
as
markers
of
OM
and
IM
integrity
.

Propidium
iodide
(
PI
)
stains
extracellular
DNA
and
DNA
in
dead
cells
.

PI
staining
also
revealed
the
presence
of
long
strands
of
genomic
DNA
,
presumably
as
a
consequence
of
the
loss
of
membrane
integrity
,
cell
lysis
and
release
of
cytoplasmic
contents
,
including
DNA
(
Fig
2B
)
.

The
DNA
released
by
lysed
cells
formed
a
mesh
-
like
coating
surrounding
and
connecting
individual
bacterial
cells
(
Fig
2B
)
.

DNA
has
cation
chelating
activity

The
rapidity
of
DNA
-
induced
cell
death
ruled
out
the
possibility
that
death
,
or
lack
of
growth
,
was
simply
due
to
cation
starvation
.

Addition
of
excess
cations
to
planktonic
cultures
inhibited
the
fast
-
acting
antimicrobial
effects
of
DNA
(
Fig
3A
)
.

The
concentration
at
which
maximal
protection
was
obtained
for
each
cation
is
represented
in
Fig
3A
(
25
mM

25
mM
Ca2

;

Mn2

;

)
.

Kill
curve
assays
indicated
that
the
addition
of
Mg2
+
,
Ca2
+
or
Mn2
+
provided
protection
from
DNA
-
induced
lysis
,
however
,
the
addition
of
Zn2
+
did
not
protect
from
DNA
-
mediated
killing
(
Fig
3A
)
.

The
increased
protection
observed
following
addition
of
Mg2
+
and
Ca2
+
is
likely
due
to
their
importance
in
membrane
integrity
where
they
function
to
stabilize
the
OM
by
crosslinking
adjacent
LPS
molecules
[
58
]
.

These
genes
encode
an
LPS
modification
pathway
required
for
the
addition
of
aminoarabinose
to
lipid
A
,
which
reduces
the
OM
permeability
to
CAPs
,
thus
conferring
resistance
[
48
]
.

Addition
of
excess
Mg2
+
(
5
mM
)
to
the
growth
medium
completely
repressed
the
expression
of
PA3553
in
cultures
supplemented
with
DNA
,
except
at
the
highest
DNA
concentration
tested
(
0
.
5
%
(
w
/
v
)
)
(
Fig

)
.

A
similar
induction
profile
of
PA3553
:
:
lux
was
observed
following
exposure
to
high
molecular
weight
P
.
aeruginosa
genomic
DNA
(
not
shown
)
or
P
.
aeruginosa
genomic
DNA
that
was
mechanically
sheared
by
sonication
(
Fig
4C
)
.

Thus
,
the
ability
of
extracellular
DNA
to
chelate
magnesium
is
independent
of
origin
and
molecular
weight
,
indicating
that
chelation
is
a
general
property
of
this
negatively
charged
polymer
.

However
the
addition
of
DNAse
buffer
to
cells
in
our
buffer
control
experiment
also
abolished
induction
of
PA3553
.

Thus
,
it
is
impossible
to
determine
conclusively
if
DNAse
treatment
of
DNA
abolished
PA3553
gene
expression
.

was
used
to
visualize
DNA
as
a
loose

in
biofilms
formed
on
polystyrene

after
24

(

as

in

One

were
washed
to
remove

gene

was

Although

in

,
both

had
similar

DNA
chelation
of
Mg2
+
,
Ca2

or
Mn2

but
not
Zn2
+
induces
PA3553
expression

At
lethal
concentrations
,
extracellular
DNA
induced
cell
lysis
by
chelating
cations
from
the
OM
.

DNA
was
capable
of
binding
all
four
cations
at
similar
levels
(
80
-
88
%
)
,
whether
alone
(
Fig

)
or
in
combination
(
data
not
shown
)
.

To
ensure
binding
was
specific
to
DNA
a
negative
control
was
included
.

The
P
.
aeruginosa
PhoQ
sensor
kinase
protein
has
been
shown
to
bind
to
and
be
repressed
by
Mg2
+
and
Ca2
+
cations
[
63
]
,
[
64
]
.

DNA
-
enriched
biofilms
were
dramatically
more
resistant
than
planktonic
cultures
,
up
to
256
-
fold
,
and
this
resistance
phenotype
to
CAPs
and
aminoglycosides
was
also
observed
in
planktonic
cultures
supplemented
with
DNA
.

The
simple
addition
of
sub
-
inhibitory
DNA
amounts
to
planktonic
cultures
closely
simulated
the
resistance
-
inducing
effects
of
DNA
in
a
biofilm
(
Table

)
.

The
MIC
values
for
polymyxin
B
and
gentamicin
are
equal
to
1
microg
/
ml
and
2
microg
/
ml
,
respectively
,
using
the
standard
microbroth
dilution
method
for
antimicrobial
susceptibility
testing
(
National
Committee
on
Clinical
Laboratory
Standards
(
NCCLS
)
protocol
)
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Thus
,
depending
on
the
method
used
to
determine
the
MIC
(
CBD
or
NCCLS
protocol
)
,
DNA
-
enriched
biofilms
can
be
up
to
2560
-
fold
more
polymyxin
B
resistant
and
up
to
640
-
fold
more
aminoglycoside
resistant
than
planktonic
cultures
.

DNA
-
enriched
biofilms
did
not
show
an
increased
tolerance
to
ceftazidime
(
beta
-
lactam
)
or
ciprofloxacin
(
fluoroquinolone
)
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Since
extracellular
DNA
is
a
natural
matrix
component
of
PAO1
biofilms
(
Fig
5A
and
5B
)
,
DNA
-
induced
antibiotic
resistance
is
likely
to
be
a
phenomenon
unique
to
biofilms
or
other
DNA
rich
environments
.

We
have
shown
previously
that
the
PA3552
-
PA3559
operon
is
required
for
resistance
to
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
in
planktonic
cultures
grown
in
limiting
magnesium
conditions
[
47
]
.

To
determine
if
DNA
-
induced
resistance
requires
these
genes
in
biofilms
,
the
resistance
phenotype
of
the
PA3553
:
:
lux
mutant
was
determined
.

The
biofilms
formed
by
the
PA3553
:
:
lux
mutant
were
unaltered
compared
to
PAO1
biofilms
under
these
conditions
,
ensuring
that
the
difference
observed
was
not
due
to
an
altered
biofilm
phenotype
(
Fig
6B
)
.

The
CAP
resistance
phenotype
of
biofilms
grown
in
limiting
magnesium
(
20
microM
)
was
similar
to
biofilms
grown
in
DNA
,
confirming
that
DNA
imposes
a
magnesium
limitation
stress
(
Table
2
)
.

Therefore
,
the
DNA
-
induced
resistance
of
biofilms
requires
both
the
cultivation
and
challenge
under
cation
-
limiting
conditions
.

Discussion

The
ability
of
P
.
aeruginosa
to
form
biofilms
promotes
survival
of
the
bacteria
in
the
presence
of
antimicrobials
and
host
defense
mechanisms
and
is
thought
to
contribute
significantly
to
its
ability
to
survive
long
-
term
within
the
hostile
environment
of
chronically
-
infected
patients
.

Understanding
the
mechanisms
underlying
antibiotic
resistance
and
especially
biofilm
-
specific
antimicrobial
resistance
is
of
significant
importance
in
the
development
of
new
treatment
options
and
/
or
strategies
.

As
an
intracellular
pathogen
,
the
PhoPQ
system
of
Salmonella
typhimurium
is
activated
by
limiting
magnesium
in
vitro
and
phoP
-
regulated
genes
are
also
induced
after
invasion
of
macrophages
and
epithelial
cells
[
65
]
.

These
observations
suggested
that
Mg2
+
is
limiting
within
host
cells
,
but
it
was
recently
shown
that
vacuole
acidification
and
low
pH
is
the
crucial
environmental
trigger
of
PhoPQ
activation
[
66
]
.

Many
extracellular
pathogens
possess
homologs
of
the
cation
-
sensing
PhoPQ
TCS
that
responds
to
magnesium
limitation
and
induces
genes
necessary
for
surviving
this
environmental
challenge
[
65
]
.

However
,
to
date
the
identification
of
a
relevant
in
vivo
environment
for
P
.
aeruginosa
which
is
cation
limited
has
remained
elusive
.

We
have
demonstrated
that
DNA
-
rich
environments
,
such
as
biofilms
,
are
cation
limited
.

In
S
.
typhimurium
,
PhoPQ
regulates
multiple
LPS
modifications
that
decrease
the
OM
permeability
to
membrane
cationic
dyes
,
bile
salts
and
antibiotics
,
including
gentamicin
[

]
.

We
report
here
that
DNA
-
induces
aminoglycoside
resistance
in
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
,
and
this
resistance
is
partially
dependent
on
the
LPS
modification
operon
PA3552
-
PA3559
.

Previous
reports
have
documented
the
involvement
of
P
.
aeruginosa
PmrAB
[
49
]
and
the
E
.
coli
PmrAB
homologs
BasRS
[
69
]
in
regulating
the
formation
of
an
antimicrobial
peptide
-
tolerant
subpopulation
within
biofilms
.

In
pure
culture
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
,
genomic
DNA
localizes
throughout
the
biofilm
surface
monolayer
and
surrounds
the
mushroom
-
shaped
microcolonies
[
51
]
.

This
coincides
with
the
localization
of
a
CAP
-
tolerant
subpopulation
of
bacteria
that
expresses
the
PA3552
-
PA3559
operon
along
the
surface
of
mushroom
-
structured
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
[
49
]
.

To
date
,
it
was
thought
unlikely
that
a
biofilm
environment
may
be
cation
limited
.

Above
certain
concentrations
(
approximately0
.
5
%
(
w
/
v
)
)
extracellular
DNA
inhibited
planktonic
growth
and
biofilm
formation
.

This
data
supports
the
hypothesis
that
the
release
of
genomic
DNA
by
lysed
cells
following
exposure
to
inhibitory
concentrations
of
extracellular
DNA
may
result
in
a
continual
release
of
DNA
by
dying
cells
and
a
DNA
gradient
within
the
biofilm
.

Our
observation
that
DNA
imposes
a
cation
gradient
in
biofilm
is
also
consistent
with
previous
reports
of
oxygen
and
nutrient
gradients
within
biofilms
,
which
result
in
diverse
physiological
cellular
states
within
a
biofilm
community
[
72
]
.

It
has
previously
been
reported
that
Mg2
+
concentrations
within
the
airway
surface
fluid
are
high
(
2
.
2
mM
)
[
73
]
,
[
74
]
.

However
,
sputum
samples
from
the
lungs
of
CF
patients
have
very
high
concentrations
of
DNA
,
up
to
20
mg
/
ml
(
2
%
(
w
/
v
)
)
[
75
]
,
[
76
]
.

It
is
likely
that
within
the
CF
lung
,
localized
cation
limited
environments
exist
within
DNA
-
rich
microcolonies
.

Therefore
,
it
appears
that
there
are
multiple
environmental
signals
in
the
CF
lung
that
can
induce
the
expression
the
PA3552
-
PA3559
operon
,
which
may
explain
why
many
P
.
aeruginosa
CF
isolates
show
LPS
modifications
such
as
aminoarabinose
addition
to
lipid
A
[
78
]
.

As
many
P
.
aeruginosa
strains
isolated
from
the
CF
lung
overproduce
the
negatively
charged
EPS
alginate
,
we
hypothesized
that
alginate
may
also
be
a
relevant
in
vivo
signal
inducing
expression
of
the
PA3552
-
PA3559
operon
.

However
,
induction
of
PA3553
gene
expression
does
not
occur
in
the
presence
of
alginate
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Furthermore
,
these
findings
indicate
that
DNA
-
rich
environments
,
such
as
bacterial
biofilms
or
the
CF
lung
,
may
represent
the
natural
setting
where
bacterial
growth
is
cation
limited
,
and
highlight
the
importance
of
the
PhoPQ
/
PmrAB
controlled
response
and
LPS
modifications
in
antibiotic
resistance
in
biofilms
.

The
DeltavicK
mutant
is
attenuated
in
virulence
in
both
subcutaneous
and
intranasal

in

DeltavicK
grows
less
slowly
than
the
parent
strain
but
retains
the
ability
of
S

equi
to
resist
to
phagocytosis
by
polymorphoneuclear
leukocytes
,
suggesting
that
the

.

Intranasal
DeltavicK

induces

These

indicate
that
VicRK

the
potential

INTRODUCTION

Bacterial
pathogens
produce
many
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
to
regulate
gene
expression
by
specific
environmental
signals
[
1
]
.

The
regulator
is
phosphorylated
by
the
sensor
in
response
to
a
specific
signal
,
activating
or
repressing
the
transcription
of
target
genes
.

The
two
-
component
regulatory
system
VicRK
or
YycFG
is
specific
for
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
.

The
hyaluronic
acid
capsule
and
S
.
equi
M
-
like
protein
(
SeM
)
are
both
required
for
the
resistance
to
phagocytosis
by
PMNs
[
16
-
17
]
.

Most
horses
recovered
from
strangles
have
immunity
against
S
.
equi
reinfection
for
up
to
5
years
[
18
]
.

An
intranasal
vaccine
made
of
live
attenuated
strain
has
been
used
in
USA
,
which
lacks
the
hyaluronic
acid
capsule
,
and
various
adverse
effects
,
including
pharyngeal
lymphadenopathy
,
limb
edema
,
and
bastard
strangles
abscesses
,
have
been
reported
[
15
]
.

This
study
aims
at
evaluating
the
importance
of
VicRK
to
S
.
equi
virulence
and
the
potential
of
a
vicK
deletion
mutant
as
a
live
vaccine
using
mouse
infection
models
.

The
two
upstream
and
downstream
flanking
fragments
of
the
internal
vicK
fragment
from
Tyr151
to
Ser427
to
be
deleted
were
cloned
at
the
upstream
and
downstream
ends
of
the
aad
gene
,
respectively
,
resulting
in
suicide
plasmid
pGRV
-
DeltavicK
.

Single
crossover
between
one
flanking
fragment
in
pGRV
-
DeltavicK
and
the
homologous
region
in
the
genome
would
lead
to
the
insertion
of
the
whole
plasmid
into
S
.
equi
genome
,
resulting
in
strains
resistant
to
both
spectinomycin
and
chloramphenicol
.

Double
crossoverat
both
of
the
flanking
fragments
would
lead
to
the
replacement
of
the
vicK
internal
fragment
with
the
aad
gene
,
resulting
in
vicK
deletion
strains
with
resistance
only
to
spectinomycin
.

Three
putative
DeltavicK
strains
,
which
were
spectinomycin
-
resistant
and
chloramphenicol
-
sensitive
,
were
obtained
.

DNA
sequencing
confirmed
the
desired
deletion
.

One
deletion
strain
was
randomly
chosen
for
further
characterization
.

The
effect
of
the
deletion
on
S
.
equi
growth
in
blood
was
also
examined
.

The
samples
were
incubated
for
4
h
,
and
the
numbers
of
the
bacteria
in
the
samples
and
inocula
at
time
zero
were
determined
by
plating
.

The
growth
factors
,
the
ratio
of
cfu
in
the
sample
at
4
h
over
cfu
at
time
zero
,
were
250
and
66
for
the
wild
type
and
DeltavicK
strains
,
respectively
(

at
both

in

(

,
indicating
that
the
DeltavicK

retains
the
ability
of
S

equi
to
resist
to

by
PMNs
.

were

The

was
performed
in

All

the

died
(

To

whether

confers
immunity
against

,
the

.

Six
of
the
7

survived

(

,
suggesting
that
the
DeltavicK

induces

.

Intranasal

Induces
SeM

Specific
Mucosal
IgA
and
Systemic

To
examine
the
humoral
immune
responses
in
the
intranasal
DeltavicK
infection
,
nasal
wash
and
serum
samples
were
collected
from
the
8
mice
infected
intranasally
with
DeltavicK
and
3
surviving
mice
infected
with
the

.
equi
30
days
after
infection
.

Half
of
the
nasal

samples
from
the
mice
infected
with
DeltavicK
had
similar
levels
of
SeM38

260
-
IgA
reactivity
with
those
from
the
mice
infected
with
the
wild

type
strains
.

Western

analysis
was
used
to
confirm
the
presence
of
SeM
-
specific
IgG
.

We
successfully
deleted
the
vicK
gene
of
S
.
equi
.

Thus
,
VicK
is
not
essential
in
S
.
equi
.

However
,
the
DeltavicK
mutant
is
attenuated
in
virulence
in
both
mouse
models
of
subcutaneous
and
intranasal
S
.
equi
infections
,
indicating
that
VicRK
is
important
to
virulence
.

The
results
provide
the
further
evidence
for
the
importance
of
VicRK
to
virulence
of
Gram
-
positive
pathogens
.

The
phenotypes
of
the
S
.
equi
DeltavicK
mutant
are
similar
to
those
of
the
S
.
pyogenes
DeltavicK
mutant
[

]
,
suggesting
that
the
growth
defect
phenotype
may
be
a
common
feature
of
the
vicRK
mutants
of
various
Gram
-
positive
pathogens
.

The
DeltavicK
mutant
appears
to
possess
the
properties
of
a
potential
live
vaccine
.

First
,
it
is
attenuated
in
virulence
in
the
mouse
infection
models
.

Thirdly
,
most
of
the
mice
with
intranasal
DeltavicK
infection
produce
mucosal
IgA
and
systemic
IgG
specific
to
protective
antigen
SeM
.

However
,
whether
DeltavicK
can
be
an
effective
live
vaccine
and
whether
the
DeltavicK
mutant
has
any
advantages
over
the
current
live
S

equi
vaccine
require
the
test
of
the
mutant
in
horses
since
S

equi
does
not
naturally
infect

.

We
hope
to
perform
this
expensive
test
in
future
when

are
available

Coordinated
Regulation
of
Virulence
during
Systemic
Infection
of
Salmonella
enterica
Serovar
Typhimurium

Overall
,
35
regulators
were
identified
whose
absence
attenuated
virulence
in
at
least
one
assay
,
and
of
those
,
14
regulators
were
required
for
systemic
mouse
infection
,
the
most
stringent
virulence
assay
.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
interplay
between
a
pathogen
and
its
host
from
a
systems
biology
standpoint
,
we
focused
on
these
14
genes
.

These
results
,
as
well
as
publicly
available
transcriptional
profiles
,
were
analyzed
using
both
network
inference
and
cluster
analysis
algorithms
.

The
analysis
predicts
a
regulatory
network
in
which
all
14
regulators
control
the
same
set
of
genes
necessary
for
Salmonella
to
cause
systemic
infection
.

These
experiments
validated
the
regulatory
model
and
showed
that
the
response
regulator
SsrB
and
the
MarR
type
regulator
,
SlyA
,
are
the
terminal
regulators
in
a
cascade
that
integrates
multiple
signals
.

In
addition
to
fluid
and
electrolyte
loss
,
non
-
typhoidal
Salmonella
often
results
in
septicemia
in
children
and
in
HIV
infected
adults
in
developing
countries
with
a
fatality
rate
of
25
%
or
greater
[
2
]
.

More
than
4
%
of
the
entire
genome
is
required
for
Typhimurium
to
infect
the
mouse
[
3
]
.

Numerous
studies
have
assigned
a
small
fraction
of
these
genes
to
specific
steps
in
mouse
infection
but
most
are
still
a
mystery
.

These
regions
include
two
40
kb
stretches
of
DNA
termed
Salmonella
pathogenicity
islands
1
(
SPI
-
1
)
and
2
(
SPI
-
2
)
[

]
-
[

]
.

The
two
type
III
secretion
systems
are
expressed
under
different
environmental
conditions
and
play
distinct
roles
in
pathogenesis
.

During
the
course
of
systemic
infection
in
mice
,
bacteria
are
found
within
neutrophils
,
monocytes
,
dendritic
cells
,
and
B
and
T
cells
but
are
not
found
extracellularly
until
the
last
one
or
two
days
immediately
before
death
of
the
mouse
[
15
]
-
[
17
]
.

Technological
advances
in
the
last
10
years
such
as
microarrays
,
whole
genome
sequences
,
and
global
proteomics
have
provided
a
more
complete
picture
of
gene
expression
for
a
number
of
bacteria
.

The
goal
of
the
current
work
is
to
develop
a
predictive
model
for
host
-
pathogen
interactions
that
will
provide
insight
into
how
Salmonella
responds
to
specific
conditions
in
the
host
.

We
have
used
SEBINI
(
Software
Environment
for
Biological
Network
Inference
;
[
18
]
)
to
directly
compare
multiple
network
algorithms
.

The
analysis
of
our
data
provided
a
testable
regulatory
hierarchy
and
a
list
of
genes
with
similar
expression
profiles
as
described
below

Typhimurium
encodes
a
surfeit
of

(
more

presumably
because
it

/
c
,
129X1
/
SvJ
mice
have
a
functional
copy
of
Nramp1
and
the
bacteria
persist
for
several
weeks
without
killing
the
mouse
[
13
]
,
[
26
]
.

The
CI
test
identified
30
(
out
of
83
)
regulator
mutants
that
were
attenuated
in
comparison
to
the
wild
type
control
(
see
Table
S1
)
.

Salmonella
transcription
profiles
for
the
following
regulators
have
already
been
reported
:
rpoE
[
27
]
;
phoP
/
phoQ
[
28
]
;
ssrA
/
ssrB
[
29
]
;
csrA
[
30
]
;
slyA
[
31
]
;
ihf
[
32
]
;
hfq
[
33
]
.

To
validate
this
result
we
complemented
the
spvR
mutation
in
trans
and
found
complete
complementation
in
mouse
virulence
(
Figure
S1
)
.

The
differences
between
our
results
and
others
are
most
likely
related
to
the
different
strains
of
Salmonella
used
in
the
studies
[
34
]
.

The
ability
of
Salmonella
to
survive
and
replicate
in
macrophages
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
for
mouse
virulence

Previous
work
demonstrated
that
Salmonella
mutants
that
were
unable
to
survive
within
elicited
peritoneal
macrophages
were
attenuated
for
virulence
during
systemic
mouse
infection
[
36
]
.

Salmonella
is
within
blood
monocytes
and
in
other
WBC
in
the
spleen
including
neutrophils
,
dendritic
cells
,
and
B
and
T
cells
in
these
reports
(
ibid
)
.

Thus
,
some
of
the
regulatory
mutations
described
here
may
affect
growth
in
cells
types
other
than
macrophages
.

We
therefore
wished
to
determine
if
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
growth
in
macrophages
and
mouse
virulence
.

In
these
studies
we
used
primary
bone
marrow
-
derived
macrophages
(
BMDM
)
from
the
same
strain
of
mouse
as
used
in
the
original
identification
of
attenuated
regulatory
mutants
(
BALB
/
c
)
.

The
identical
number
of
input
bacteria
and
the
identical
number
of
macrophages
were
used
in
every
infection
experiment
.

We
monitored
the
number
of
intracellular
bacteria
at
an
early
time
(
30
min
)
to
determine
the
number
of
bacteria
internalized
(
Figure
2
)
.

Even
at
the
shortest
time
few
intracellular
bacteria
were
recovered
from
macrophage
infection
with
an
rpoE
mutant
,
suggesting
that
this
strain
is
very
sensitive
to
microbicidal
factors
released
by
macrophages
on
contact
with
bacteria
or
doesn
'
t
get
internalized
very
well
.

Finally
,
at
18
hrs
bacterial
numbers
were
enumerated
to
monitor
intracellular
replication
as
well
as
the
ability
to
withstand
nitrous
oxide
oxidation
and
other
late
antimicrobial
factors
[
39
]
,
[
40
]
.

Small
differences
in
intracellular
growth
were
observed
for
ssrA
/
ssrB
and
slyA
compared
to
the
parent
although
larger
differences
have
been
observed
previously
[
43
]
-
[
45
]
perhaps
reflecting
BMDM
preparation
techniques
,
bacterial
strain
differences
,
or
opsonization
differences
[
46
]
.

The
14
virulence
regulators
,
whose
absence
was
identified
by
attenuated
virulence
in
vivo
in
this
study
,
presumably
sense
specific
environmental
signals
within
the
host
and
respond
by
expressing
the
appropriate
complement
of
virulence
factors
.

Two
different
minimal
media
conditions
were
used
depending
only
on
pre
-
growth
conditions
as
described
in
the
Materials
and
Methods
(
called
acidic
minimal
media
(
AMM
)
1
and
AMM2
here
)
;
these
conditions
are
identical
to
conditions
previously
reported
for
expression
of
SPI
-
2
;
[
47
]
,
[
48
]
.

The
fate
of
intracellular
Typhimurium
is
determined
by
pre
-
growth
conditions
prior
to
macrophage
infection
and
for
that
reason
we
used
both
conditions
AMM1
and
2
[
49
]
.

To
identify
global
transcriptional
changes
for
each
regulator
,
mRNAs
were
isolated
from
each
strain
grown
under
the
four
conditions
,
converted
to
cDNA
,
and
used
to
probe
a
spotted
non
-
redundant
pan
-
Salmonella
orf
microarray
using
hybridization
of
total
genomic
Salmonella
DNA
as
an
internal
control
[
50
]
.

Each
microarray
was
probed
with
RNA
from
the
parent
or
an
isogenic
deletion
of
one
of
the
regulator
mutants
prepared
from
bacterial
cells
grown
under
one
of
the
four
conditions
.

In
all
there
were
4
biological
replicates
of
the
parent
strain
but
one
for
each
mutant
under
each
growth
condition
.

Transcriptional
profiles
were
significantly
different
from
the
parent
for
known
virulence
factors
required
during
systemic
infection
,
but
only
if
cells
were
grown
in
acidic
minimal
media
(
AMM1
or
AMM2
;
see
Figure

.

Statistical
analysis
of
the
complete
transcriptional
data
for
gene
expression
in
AMM1
identified
at
least
237
genes
that
were
reduced
4
-
fold
or
more
in
common
comparing
the
mutations
to
the
parent
strain
(
at
least
3
standard
deviation
based
on
the
technical
replicates
)
.

All
in
all
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
normal
function
of
each
of
the
14
regulators
is
to
activate
transcription
of
virulence
factors
necessary
for
systemic
infection
but
only
under
specific
environmental
conditions
.

Validation
of
SPI
-
2
regulation

To
assess
the
effects
of
growth
conditions
on
expression
of
the
SPI
-
2
secretion
apparatus
we
constructed
a
lacZ
transcriptional
fusion
to
ssaG
,
a
component
of
the
secretion
apparatus
,
and
tested
expression
in
each
mutant
background
under
each
of
the
four
growth
conditions
.

At
the
same
time
we
determined
transcript
levels
via
quantitative
real
-
time
PCR
(
qRT
-
PCR
)
,
using
transcripts
from
rpoD
and
gyrB
as
controls
[
51
]
.

We
observed
that
the
results
determined
by
these
two
methods
matched
closely
(
Figure
S2
)
and
that
the
level
of
transcription
of
ssaG
was
highest
when
Salmonella
was
grown
in
minimal
acidic
media
.

To
validate
the
transcriptional
profiles
we
prepared
RNA
from
mutants
and
parent
bacteria
grown
in
acidic
minimal
medium
and
used
as
template
for
qRT
-
PCR
.

Six
promoters
have
been
identified
for
the
type
III
secretion
system
encoded
within
SPI
-
2
(
see
Figure
4
;
[
52
]
)
.

We
monitored
transcription
of
seven
genes
within
SPI
-
2
,
covering
each
operon
at
least
once
,
and
used
gyrB
transcript
as
an
internal
control
.

Strains
containing
mutations
in
phoP
/
phoQ
,
ssrA
/
ssrB
,
slyA
,
and
ompR
/
envZ
showed
at
least
100
-
fold
decreases
in
transcription
of
all
SPI
-
2
genes
(
Figure
4
)
.

Mutations
of
ihf
(
himD
)
and
csrA
showed
an
intermediate
level
of
8
-
16
-
fold
decreased
transcription
whereas
hnr
,
rpoE
,
smpB
,
crp
and
hfq
showed
a
modest
decrease
of
2
-
8
-
fold
.

Note
that
rpoE
and
hfq
mutants
showed
a
dramatic
reduction
in
macrophage
survival
,
but
little
difference
in
transcription
of
SPI
-
2
genes
during
growth
in
AMM
.

Furthermore
,
Hfq
regulates
translation
of
more
than
20
%
of
all
Salmonella
proteins
explaining
why
a
mutation
in
this
gene
has
such
a
dramatic
phenotype

Cluster
analysis
identifies
additional
genes
that
are
co
-
regulated
with
known
virulence
factors

We
searched
for
additional
previously
unidentified
virulence
factors
encoded
elsewhere
on
the
chromosome
that
show
the
same
pattern
of
expression
as
those
located
within
SPI
-
2
.

A
systematic
way
of
identifying
co
-
regulation
is
with
one
of
several
computer
algorithms
that
group
genes
together
if
their
expression
is
similarly
changed
under
like
conditions
.

The
diverse
growth
conditions
used
in
this
study
,
as
well
as
differences
between
isogenic
strains
containing
mutations
in
virulence
regulators
,
make
our
data
set
ideal
for
this
type
of
analysis
.

In
addition
,
we
also
performed
cluster
analysis
using
public
data
sets
acquired
from
the
NIH
sponsored
public
repository
of
microarray
data
,
gene
expression
omnibus
(
GEO
)
.

We
chose
120
transcriptional
profiles
from
GEO
that
were
derived
by
extracting
RNA
from
the
same
parent
Salmonella
strain
grown
under
a
wide
variety
of
culture
conditions
(
GSE2456
;
G
.
Yun
et
al
.
,
unpublished
data
)
.

Expression
profiles
for
all
genes
were
uploaded
to
SEBINI
(
Software
Environment
for
Biological
Network
Inference
[
18
]
)
.

The
results
shown
in
Figure
5
use
a
force
-
directed
network
layout
algorithm
where
genes
(
shown
as
small
colored
circles
)
are
generally
closer
together
when
their
statistical
association
,
and
thus
degree
of
predicted
co
-
regulation
,
is
stronger
(
the
cutoff
for
the
genes
shown
is
5
standard
deviations
from
the
mean
or
greater
;
p
<
.
0001
)
.

The
cluster
analysis
identified
92
genes
that
are
co
-
regulated
with
the
SPI
-
2
encoded
type
III
secretion
system
but
not
located
within
SPI
-
2
.

We
analyzed
expression
of
each
of
the
123
genes
and
found
that
only
two
genes
(
pepA
and
mopB
)
are
negatively
regulated
;
the
remaining
121
are
positively
regulated
.

The
fact
that
all
of
the
14
regulators
in
this
study
have
biological
functions
during
infection
suggests
they
could
be
part
of
a
coordinated
network
.

To
identify
coordinated
regulation
we
compared
expression
of
each
regulator
in
each
mutant
background
when
grown
in
minimal
acidic
medium
(
Figure
6A
)
.

A
matrix
with
14
mutants
in
columns
and
14
regulatory
genes
and
SPI
-
2
genes
(
6
genes
except
for
ssrB
as
used
in
Figure
4
)
in
rows
was
constructed
based
on
qRT
-
PCR
data
and
z
-
scores
were
calculated
based
on
average
and
standard
deviations
from
columns
and
rows
.

A
network
among
regulators
and
SPI
-
2
was
mapped
as
described
in
Lee
et
al
.
by
sorting
out
values
that
changed
in
a
specific
mutant
background
[
59
]
.

However
,
direct
or
indirect
regulation
cannot
be
distinguished
without
additional
experimental
verification
.

So
,
in
Figure
6B
all
regulatory
effects
on
SPI
-
2
have
been
removed
except
for
those
mediated
directly
by
slyA
and
ssrB
based
on
additional
genetic
data
as
described
below
.

An
overall
network
was
also
generated
by
integrating
4
data
sets
;
two
CLR
algorithm
data
from
the
complete
microarray
results
and
GSE2456
public
microarray
database
and
two
matrix
analysis
data
from
the
transcription
profiles
and
qRT
-
PCR
results
(
Figure
S3
;
the
limitation
is
that
no
distinction
is
made
between
positive
and
negative
regulation
in
CLR
algorithm
data
)
.

The
consensus
network
combining
all
data
reported
in
this
study
includes
the
network
computed
from
qRT
-
PCR
(
Figure
6B
)
in
part
and
suggests
a
predictive
regulatory
cascade
that
merits
a
test
.

However
the
location
of
binding
sites
varies
suggesting
that
SsrB
regulation
is
unusual
[
52
]
.

Some
of
the
14
regulators
in
this
study
have
been
previously
shown
to
directly
regulate
ssrA
/
ssrB
;
OmpR
binding
to
PssrA
/
ssrB
[
60
]
,
[
61
]
;
SlyA
binding
to
PssrA
[
62
]
;
PhoP
binding
to
PssrB
[
45
]
.

Each
isogenic
derivative
was
transformed
with
either
pBAD30SsrB
or
the
empty
vector
control
.

Expression
of
an
episomal
copy
of
ssrB
resulted
in
expression
of
SPI
-
2
genes
in
each
mutant
background
,
suggesting
that
SsrB
is
epistatic
to
other
regulators
for
SPI
-
2
transcription
.

Furthermore
,
SsrB
could
complement
all
three
deletions
DeltassrB
,
DeltassrA
,
and
DeltassrA
/
ssrB
(
Figure
7B
)
,
suggesting
that
over
-
expression
of
SsrB
may
compensate
for
differences
in
phosphorylation
that
normally
play
a
role
in
regulation
[
52
]
.

The
number
of
inputs
at
each
regulator
shown
in
Figure
6B
corresponds
to
the
number
of
regulators
that
directly
or
indirectly
control
its
expression
.

The
number
of
regulators
that
act
on
slyA
was
surprising
.

Quantitative
RT
-
PCR
confirmed
that
slyA
transcription
was
reduced
in
11
of
14
mutant
backgrounds
(
Figure
6A
)
.

The
construct
strongly
complemented
ompR
/
envZ
,
phoP
/
phoQ
,
csrA
and
himD
,
suggesting
that
the
effect
of
these
regulators
on
SPI
-
2
expression
may
be
indirect
via
regulation
of
slyA
.

To
test
this
possibility
we
constructed
double
deletions
of
ssrAB
/
ompRenvZ
,
ssrAB
/
phoPQ
,
ssrAB
/
csrA
and
ssrAB
/
himD
.

As
shown
in
Figure
7D
,
slyA
is
capable
of
activating
expression
of
SPI
-
2
genes
independently
of
ssrB
,
ompR
/
envZ
,
phoP
/
phoQ
,
csrA
and
himD
(
ihf
)
,
although
the
effects
are
not
as
strong
as
ssrB
.

Furthermore
there
was
a
clear
dichotomy
in
expression
between
the
first
two
SPI
-
2
operons
encoding
ssaB
-
ssaE
and
sseA
-
sseG
and
the
operons
further
downstream
(
ssaG
-
ssaQ
)
suggesting
that
slyA
may
act
at
different
sites
within
SPI
-
2
.

However
,
these
experiments
are
based
on
over
-
expression
of
slyA
that
may
complicate
the
analysis
because
of
binding
to
sites
that
would
normally
not
be
occupied
.

Salmonella
follows
a
short
course
of
infection
after
intraperitoneal
infection
,
as
we
have
used
here
,
passing
through
the
lymph
nodes
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
to
the
blood
stream
and
then
colonizing
and
replicating
within
the
spleen
and
liver
.

RNA
was
therefore
prepared
using
four
laboratory
growth
conditions
two
of
which
partially
mimic
the
intracellular
environment
(
acidic
minimal
media
)
.

We
compared
the
transcriptional
profiles
we
observed
using
laboratory
growth
conditions
that
mimic
intracellular
conditions
,
to
those
that
have
been
performed
during
intracellular
replication
within
J774
macrophage
like
cells
.

[
67
]
thus
providing
a
value
that
can
be
compared
across
different
experiments
.

As
the
expression
pattern
changes
with
time
after
infection
we
computed
the
difference
for
each
time
as
well
as
an
average
for
all
three
-
time
points
reported
(
4
,
8
,
and
12
hours
after
infection
)
.

Four
of
the
5
most
strongly
differentially
induced
genes
include
magnesium
transporters
(
mgtB
and
mgtC
)
,
an
acid
shock
protein
(
STM1485
)
,
and
a
high
affinity
phosphate
transporter
(
pstS
)
suggesting
that
the
acidic
minimal
media
we
used
may
not
be
low
enough
in
magnesium
,
phosphate
,
or
may
not
be
sufficiently
acidic
.

Examples
of
such
genes
include
sifA
and
the
operon
STM3117
-
3120
.

The
nature
of
the
inducing
signal
(
s
)
that
results
in
expression
of
these
genes
during
intracellular
growth
is
not
known
.

In
our
transcriptional
network
each
pink
node
represents
a
regulator
(
Figure
6
B
)
and
lines
represent
positive
or
negative
transcriptional
interactions
(
positive
in
red
and
negative
in
blue
)
.

Many
of
these
predicted
relationships
have
been
demonstrated
already
but
some
are
new
and
merit
further
investigation
.

For
SPI
-
2
ssrB
plays
this
role
and
for
SPI
-
1
hilA
is
the
central
regulator
.

The
multiple
promoters
located
within
SPI
-
2

There

,
including
those
whose

,
those

,
or
those
that
were
simply
missed
in
the

(

)
;
these
regulators
will
be
included
in
subsequent
analyses
.

There
have
been

to

It
is
surprising
that

of

can
compensate
for
a
deletion
of
ssrA

Yet
,

of

results
in
expression
of
all

examined
(

.

Mutations
in

and

showed
only
small
decreases

transcription
during
growth
in
minimal
acidic
media
but
some
of
them
showed
large
defects
in
survival
assays
performed
in
murine
macrophages
.

For
rpoE
and
rpoS
it
is
possible
that
the
environmental
conditions
that
distinguish
growth
in
minimal
media
from
those
in
the
SCV
inside
hosts
are
sensed
via
these
two
alternative
sigma
factors
.

Post

transcriptional
SPI

regulation
is
a
likely
explanation
for
the
large
intracellular
growth
defects
observed
in
the
mutant
smpB
and
hfq
derivatives
despite
relative
small
transcriptional
effects
.

Perhaps
these
regulators
are
selected
during
growth
in
other
cell
types
or
within
phagocytic
cells
that
are
activated
as
a
consequence
of
the
inflammatory
response
generated
by
the
bacteria
.

SlyA
and
SsrA
/
SsrB
together
activate

of

SlyA
is
a
DNA

binding
protein
with
high
affinity
for
inverted

sequences
[
79
]
and
the
binding
ability
of
SlyA
to
the
ssrA
promoter
region
was
previously
reported
[
62
]
.

SPI
-
2
regulation
by
SsrB
and
SlyA
may
be
explained
in
a
similar
mechanism
where
both
SlyA
and
SsrB
counteract
the
silencing
activity
of
H
-
NS
/
YdgT
/
Hha
by
competing
for
binding
to
the
same
target
sequences
or
by
altering
the
structure
of
the
DNA
to
promote
transcription
for
SPI

.

[
81
]
found
that
there
was
no
consensus
SsrB
binding
site
or
distance
relative
to
the
transcription
start
sites
and
Walthers
(
ibid
)
proposes
that
different
promoters
may
be
activated
by
distinct
SsrB
mechanisms
.

Our
results
support
this
conclusion
and
extend
the
observation
to
slyA
at
least
for
specific
SPI
-
2
transcripts
.

Thus
,
one
explanation
for
the
transcription
we
observe
following
over
-
expression
of
ssrB
or
slyA
may
be
that
both
SlyA
and
SsrB
counteract
binding
of
small
nucleoid

proteins
including
both
H

Clustering

and
co

expression

The
complex
regulatory
network
suggested
by
these
studies
has
been
partially
confirmed
.

Complete
elucidation
of
the
virulence
pathways
must
include
proteomic
studies
to
identify
steps
that
require
translational
regulation
,
binding
studies
to
distinguish
direct
from
indirect
effects
and
additional
regulators
not
included
in
this
preliminary
group
of
14
.

In
this
study
,
cluster
analysis
was
used
to
identify
genes
that
show
similar
expression
profiles
under
a
variety
of
environmental
conditions
and
from
the
isogenic
Salmonella
regulatory
mutants
we
describe
.

The
average
G

content
of
the
92
genes
outside
of
SPI

that
show
the

is
47
%
while
the

for

is

.

The
construction
of
a
complete
interaction
network
describing
both
the
host
and
pathogen
is
a
long

term
goal
of
this
and
other

Induction
of

also
occurs
when
M

tuberculosis
encounters
conditions
associated
with
growth
arrest
,
such
as
the
intracellular
milieu
of
macrophages
and
in
the
lungs
of
mice
with
chronic
tuberculosis
.

Therefore
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
Rv2623
regulates
tuberculosis
latency
.

We
observed
that
an
Rv2623
-
deficient
mutant
fails
to
establish
chronic
tuberculous
infection
in
guinea
pigs
and
mice
,
exhibiting
a
hypervirulence
phenotype
associated
with
increased
bacterial

and
mortality
.

Consistent
with
this
in

growth
-
regulatory
role
,
constitutive
overexpression
of
rv2623
attenuates
mycobacterial
growth
in

.

Biochemical
analysis
of
purified
Rv2623
suggested
that
this
mycobacterial
USP
binds
ATP
,
and
the

A

revealed
that
Rv2623
engages

pocket
.

Structure
-
guided
mutagenesis
yielded
Rv2623
mutants
with

.

We
propose
that
Rv2623
may
function
as
an
ATP
-
dependent
signaling
intermediate
in
a
pathway
that
promotes
persistent
infection
.

The
remaining
90
%
of
the
infected

are
asymptomatic
,
and
are
generally
believed
to
harbor
latent

that
can
reactivate
to
cause
tuberculous

,
sometimes
decades
after
the
initial

.

Understanding
the

will
guide
the

Nitric

produced
by

and

are

likely
to
be
encountered
within

that
are
believed
,
based
on
in

,
to
promote

by
prompting
the
M

.

Among
this

is

one
of
eight

annotated
as
containing
the

[

,
[

.

Increased
expression
of
rv2623
was
also
observed
following
phagocytosis
by
macrophages
[
10
]
and
in
the
lungs
of
chronically

supporting

during

Results

Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
Rv2623
regulates
growth
in
vitro
An
rv2623
-
deletion
mutant
of
the
virulent
M
.
tuberculosis
Erdman
strain
was
generated
by
specialized
transduction
[
12
]
.

The
rv2623
-
specific
allelic
exchange
construct
was
delivered
via
recombinant
mycobacteriophage
phAE159
and
transformants
were
analyzed
by
Southern
blot
,
confirming
replacement
of
rv2623
with
the
hyg
gene
,
which
confers
hygromycin
resistance
(
Figure

)
.

However
,
the
in

growth
kinetics
of
Deltarv2623
M
.
tuberculosis
in
OADC
-
supplemented
Middlebrook

or

s
medium
is
comparable
to
that
of
wildtype
Erdman
up
to
14
days
post
-
inoculation
(
Figure
2A
)
.

We
reasoned
that
a
potential
growth
-
regulating
attribute
of
Rv2623
might
be
masked
by
functional
redundancy
among
the
M
.
tuberculosis
USP
homologs
.

As
seen
in
Figure
2B
,
constitutive
overexpression
of
M
.
tuberculosis
rv2623
using
the
multi
-
copy
plasmid
pMV261
resulted
in
growth
deficiency
of
the
recipient
strain
both
on
solid
medium
(
Middlebrook
7H10
agar
)
and
in
the
liquid
medium
-
based
BD
BACTEC
9000MB
system
.

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
regulates
mycobacterial
growth
in
vitro
.

Although
USP
family
proteins
are
expressed
by
many
bacterial
pathogens
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
,
to
date
,
there
has
only
been
one
in
vivo
study
,
which
showed
that
a
Salmonella
USP
promotes
virulence
in
mice
[
17
]
.

The
observation
that
Rv2623
modulates
mycobacterial
growth
in
vitro
prompted
us
to
examine
the
effect
of
this
USP
on
the
in
vivo
kinetics
of
M
.
tuberculosis
infection
.

Low
dose
aerosol
infection
of
outbred
Hartley
guinea
pigs
with
approximately30
CFU
revealed
a
clear
growth
advantage
of
the
Deltarv2623
mutant
strain
relative
to
wildtype
.

Finally
,
complementation
with
a
single
integrated
copy
of
rv2623
expressed
from
a
constitutive
mycobacterial
promoter
(
Deltarv2623
attB
:
:
Phsp60Rv2623
)
abrogated
the
growth
advantage
of
the
deletion
mutant
(
Figure
3A
)
.

Also
consistent
with
the
fulminate
disease
progression
displayed
by
Deltarv2623
-
infected
guinea
pigs
are
the
more
severe
pathological
changes
observed
as
early
as
20
days
post
-
infection
in
the
lungs
of
these
animals
,
as
assessed
by
histopathological
studies
,
including
the
semi
-
quantitative
Total
Lung
Score
analysis
(
Figure
3B
and
Protocol
S1
)
.

Results
of
the
complementation
experiments
were
further
validated
using
a
complemented
strain
Deltarv2623
attB
:
:
Prv2623Rv2623
,
whose
expression
of
the
wildtype
universal
stress
protein
is
driven
by
the
native
rv2623
promoter
[
18
]
(
Figure
3D
and
E
)
.

In
contrast
to
the
result
of
the
guinea
pig
study
,
we
observed
no
difference
in
the
kinetics
of
infection
between
C57BL
/
6
mice
infected
with
wildtype
M
.
tuberculosis
,
Deltarv2623
,
or
the
attB
:
:
Phsp60
Rv2623
complemented
strain
in
a
low
dose
aerogenic
model
[
19
]
,
as
assessed
by
lung
bacterial
burden
(
Figure
4A
)
.

In
fact
,
evidence
exists
that
M
.
tuberculosis
triggers
an
immune
response
in
mice
that
is
in
excess
of
that
required
for
controlling
the
infection
[
22
]
,
[
23
]
.

Thus
,
the
hypervirulence
phenotype
of
Deltarv2623
observed
in
the
susceptible
guinea
pig
model
could
have
been
masked
in
the
C57BL
/
6
mice
.

Consequently
,
we
examined
the
virulence
of
Deltarv2623
in
the
relatively
susceptible
C3H
/
HeJ
mouse
strain
[
24
]
.

Indeed
,
the
Deltarv2623
mutant
was
markedly
more
virulent
relative
to
wildtype
Erdman
M
.
tuberculosis
following
aerogenic
infection
,
as
assessed
by
the
mean
survival
time
of
C3H
/

mice
infected
with
these
strains
(
62
and

)
.

In
agreement
with
the
survival

,
quantification
of

revealed
a
growth
advantage
for
the
Rv2623

relative
to

Erdman
(
Figure

)
.

As
in
the
guinea
pig
studies
,
results
of
complementation
experiments
involving
the
reintroduction
of
a
single
copy
of
wildtype
rv2623
into
Deltarv2623
M
.
tuberculosis
reverses
the
hypervirulence
(
Figure
4C
)
exhibited
in
the
C3H
/
HeJ
model
,
thus
indicating
that
the
observed
growth
phenotype
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
deficient
for
the
universal
stress
protein
is
rv2623
-
specific
.

Effects
of
environmental
stress
on
growth
of
M
.
tuberculosis
Deltarv2623
in
vitro

Although
the
functions
of
universal
stress
proteins
have
yet
to
be
completely
defined
,
there
is
evidence
that
many
USPs
play
differential
roles
in
protecting
microbes
against
various
environmental
stresses
[
9
]
.

Therefore
,
the
hypervirulence
of
Deltarv2623
in
guinea
pigs
and
susceptible
mice
is
intriguing
;
if
Rv2623
provides
M
.
tuberculosis
protection
against
stress
,
it
might
be
expected
that
the
Rv2623
-
deficient
mutant
would
be
attenuated
in
vivo
.

The
growth
kinetics
and
survival
of
the
Deltarv2623
strain
was
examined
under
various
stress
conditions
,
including
those
likely
to
be
present
during
M
.
tuberculosis
infection
.

These
results
support
the
notion
that
it
is
unlikely
that
M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
is
essential
for
resistance
to
stresses
encountered
in
the
host
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
observed
in
vivo
hypervirulence
phenotype
of
Deltarv2623
.

M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
is
a
nucleotide
-
binding
protein

M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
was
expressed
in
E
.
coli
and
purified
to
homogeneity
for
biochemical
studies
.

SDS
-
PAGE
analysis
of
affinity
-
purified
His6
-
Rv2623
revealed
a
single
band
that
approximates
the
predicted
molecular
mass
of
approximately31
.
6
kDa
,
which
was
identified
by
immunoblotting
as
Rv2623
(
Figure
S3
)
.

On
the
basis
of
structures
of
ATP
-
binding
and
non
-
ATP
-
binding
USPs
,
a
G
-
2X
-
G
-
9X
-
G
(
S
/
T
)
motif
was
suggested
to
be
essential
for
the
binding
of
ATP
[
27
]
.

The
presence
of
this
motif
in
each
of
the
two
tandem
USP
domains
of
Rv2623
[
7
]
raised
the
possibility
that
this
protein
possesses
ATP
binding
activity
.

An
HPLC
-
based
examination
of
supernatants
from
boiled
samples
of
His6
-
Rv2623
demonstrated
that
His6
-
Rv2623
co
-
purifies
with
both
ATP
and
ADP
(
Figure
5
)
.

Analysis
of
E
.
coli
-
expressed
Rv2623
using
nano
ESI
mass
spectrometry
also
demonstrated
that
an
ATP
-
saturated
form
of
dimeric
Rv2623
(
composed
of
2
bound
ATP
molecules
per
monomer
)
constitutes
at
least
half
of
the
purified
sample
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Thus
,
Rv2623
binds
endogenous
adenine
nucleotides
in
E
.
coli
,
and
the
association
is
sufficiently
tight
that
nearly
75
%
of
the
nucleotide
binding
sites
are
occupied
upon
purification
.

Indeed
,
nucleotide
did
not
completely
dissociate
from
the
protein
following
an
extensive
,
two
-
week
dialysis
with
multiple
changes
against
nucleotide
-
free
buffer
(
approximately
0
.
3
nucleotide
equivalents
per
monomer
remain
)
.

It
is
conceivable
that
the
presence
of
ADP
is
the
consequence
of
an
Rv2623
-
associated
ATP
activity
and
this
putative
ATPase
function
is
currently
under
investigation
.

To
examine
the
biochemical
mechanisms
responsible
for
Rv2623
function
,
we
determined
the
crystal
structure
of
wild

type
Rv2623
at

The

As

a

crystal
form
of
Rv2623
(

was
released
for
public
access
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
ATP

mode
(

)
exhibited
by
Rv2623
,
the
structural
features
of
the

compared
to

of

[

.

Relatively
subtle
structural
and
phylogenetic
differences
that
exist
between
the
ATP

pockets
might
nevertheless
confer
divergent
binding
and

regulatory
properties
to
the
tandem

.

Generation

of

mutants

Similarly
,
extension
of
the
D15
side
chain
to
glutamate
was
also
predicted
to
interfere
with
the
ATP

binding
conformation
(
Figure

)
.

HPLC
analysis
of
nucleotides
extracted
from
Rv2623D15E
and
Rv2623G117A
revealed
that
the
mutant
proteins
are
indeed
deficient
in
ATP

binding
,
exhibiting
approximately34
%
(

and
approximately29

(

)
of
the
amount
of
ATP
bound
by
wild

type

,
respectively
(

.

Likewise
,
following
an
overnight
incubation
with
[
alpha

]
ATP
at
4degreesC
,
the
amount
of
protein

radioactivity
,
which
represented
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
total
ATP

,
was
significantly
less
for
the
mutant

than
wild

Rv2623
(

.

The
growth
-
regulating
property
of
M
.
tuberculosis
Rv2623
is
dependent
on
its
ability
to
bind
ATP

Results
of
these
studies
demonstrated
that
while
overexpression
of
wildtype
Rv2623
retards
the
growth
of
the
recipient
strain
relative
to
cells
transformed
with
vector
alone
,
growth
of
the
strains
overexpressing
ATP
-
binding
-
deficient
mutant
Rv2623
are
only
minimally
affected
by
overexpression
as
assessed
by
spotting
serial
dilutions
of
the
cultures
of
the
appropriate
strains
onto
solid
Middlebrook

agar
(
data
not

)
as
well
as
by
monitoring
the
time
to
detection
using
the
BD
BACTEC
9000MB
system
(
Figure

)
.

The
distinct
effects
exhibited
by
the
wild
type
and
the
G117A
and
D15E
mutants
defective
in
ATP
binding
suggests
a
direct
correlation
between
growth
attenuation
and
ATP
binding
(
Figure

)
.

To
examine
whether
the
effects
of
overexpression
of
Rv2623
on
M

are
operative
in

tuberculosis
,
the
growth

of
the

,
as
well
as

proteins
,
were
evaluated
in

using
the

(

.

Furthermore
,
this

is
not
observed
in

Discussion

Despite
the
significance
of
M
.
tuberculosis
latency
in
pathogenesis
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
tubercle
bacillus
establishes
and
maintains
the
latent
state
remain
incompletely
defined
.

Indeed
,
it
has
been
shown
that
both
the
cognate
sensor
histidine
kinase
DosS
(
a
member
of
the
dormancy
regulon
)
as
well
as
an
"
orphan
"
kinase
,
DosT
,
functioning
as
redox
and
hypoxia
sensors
,
respectively
;
can
regulate
DosR
activity
,
and
that
O2
,
NO
,
and
CO
can
modulate
the
activity
of
these
two
kinases
via
interaction
with
a
haem
prosthetic
group
[
28
]
,
[
29
]
,
[
30
]
,
[
31
]
,
[
32
]
.

There
are
eight
genes
in
the
M
.
tuberculosis
genome
annotated
to
encode
USP
family
proteins
[
7
]
.

We
studied
the
M
.
tuberculosis
USP
rv2623
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
highly
induced
genes
in
the
dormancy
regulon
when
bacilli
are
subjected
to
hypoxia
and
nitrosative
stress
[
3
]
,
[
4
]
,
[
5
]
,
[
36
]
,
[
37
]
.

More
important
,
rv2623
was
also
shown
to
be
up
-
regulated
when
the
tubercle
bacillus
is
internalized
by
human
and
mouse
macrophages
[
10
]
,
[
38
]
as
well
as
in
the
lungs
of
mice
with
persistent
M
.
tuberculosis
infection
[
11
]
.

These
latter
observations
suggest
that
the
induction
of
rv2623
may
have
biological
relevance
.

The
precise
mechanisms
by
which
Rv2623
expression
is
regulated
remain
to
be
defined
.

Recent
transcriptional
analysis
of
Rv2623
,
while
confirming
the
essentiality
of
the
two
18
bp
palindromic
DosR
-
binding
motifs
that
are
present
in
the
promoter
region
of
this
gene
[
38
]
for
induction
of
Rv2623
under
low
oxygen
conditions
,
also
demonstrated
the
presence
of
additional
regulatory
elements
within
the
rv2623
5
'
-
untranslated
region
[
18
]
.

The
M
.
tuberculosis
dormancy
response
features
a
dramatic
decrease
in
metabolic
activity
,
resulting
in
a
rapid
decrease
in
bacterial
replication
[
39
]
.

Therefore
,
it
is
possible
that
deficiency
in
certain
members
of
the
dormancy
regulon
could
result
in
inability
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
to
enter
a
latent
state
in
the
infected
host
,
leading
to
unrestrained
growth
and
thus
,
hypervirulence
.

However
,
DosR
deficiency
has
also
been
reported
to
have
no
effect
on
M
.
tuberculosis
virulence
or
to
lead
to
an
attenuated
phenotype
[
42
]
,
[
43
]
.

The
discrepancies
regarding
M
.
tuberculosis
virulence
in
these
DosR
studies
are
unclear
,
but
could
be
due
to
differences
in
experimental
systems
employed
.

Results
of
the
complementation
studies
indicate
that
the
phenotype
is
Rv2623
-
specific
.

This
growth
-
regulating
phenomenon
is
echoed
by
the
observation
that
ectopic
overexpression
of
Rv2623
results
in
attenuation
of
mycobacterial
growth
.

Together
,
these
data
strongly
suggest
that
the
M
.
tuberculosis
USP
Rv2623
has
the
ability
to
regulate
growth
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
and
is
required
for
the
establishment
of
a
persistent
infection
.

Bioinformatic
and
experimental
evidence
suggest
that
nucleotide
-
binding
capacity
represents
a
discriminating
biochemical
feature
that
facilitates
USP
protein
classification
.

Putative
functional
differences
between
USPs
are
implied
by
their
assignment
to
two
subclasses
:
one
whose
members
do
not
bind
ATP
and
another
whose
constituents
bind
and
hydrolyze
adenine
nucleotide
substrates
[
8
]
,
[
26
]
,
[
27
]
,
[
45
]
,
[
46
]
.

A
structural
comparison
between
the
prototypic
members
of
the
two
subclasses
,
the
non
-
ATP
-
binding
UspA
homolog
(
H
.
influenzae
,
PDB
ID
1JMV
)
and
the
ATP
-
binding
USP
,
MJ0577
(
M
.
jannaschii
,
PDB
ID
1MJH
)
revealed
that
while
both
proteins
exhibit
a
similar
fold
,
conserved
glycine
residues
within
the
ATP
-
binding
loop
of
the
latter
are
substituted
with
bulky
amino
acids
that
preclude
ATP
recognition
in
the
former
[
26
]
,
[
27
]
.

Specific
roles
for
USP
family
proteins
are
just
beginning
to
be
characterized
,
and
early
functional
classifications
have
been
informed
by
ATP
-
binding
capacity
[
9
]
.

Based
on
in
silico
analyses
,
Florczyk
et
al
.
classified
Rv2623
as
belonging
to
a
novel
class
of
ATPases
[
52
]
,
although
formal
evidence
for
ATP
binding
by
this
protein
has
not
been
reported
.

Furthermore
,
given
that
the
attenuated
growth
phenotype
caused
by
overexpression
of
Rv2623
could
be
abrogated
by
mutations
that
interfere
with
the
binding
of
this
protein
to
its
nucleotide
substrate
,
it
is
likely
that
the
mycobacterial
growth
-
regulatory
faculty
of
Rv2623
is
mediated
by
an
ATP
-
dependent
function
.

In
summary
,
the
results
of
the
present
study
have
revealed
that
the
M
.
tuberculosis
USP
Rv2623
has
the
ability
to
regulate
mycobacterial
growth
,
as
evident
by
the
in
vivo
hypervirulence
phenotype
of
Deltarv2623
,
which
fails
to
establish
a
persistent
infection
in
susceptible
hosts
,
as
well
as
the
growth
attenuation
observed
in
mycobacteria
overexpressing
this
USP
.

The
latent
state
allows
persistence
in
infected
individuals
of
tubercle
bacilli
that
can
reactivate
to
cause
active
disease
and
to
disseminate
when
the
immune
status
of
the
host
is
compromised
.

As
a
result
,
Rv2623
may
contribute
significantly
to
the
propagation
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
in
the
human
host
and
the
difficulties
in
eradicating
tuberculosis
.

Mechanistically
,
results
of
the
mutagenesis
studies
have
shown
that
Rv2623
regulates
growth
through
ATP
-
dependent
function
.

Clearly
,
much
remains
to
be
learned
regarding
how
the
ATP
-
dependent
function
of
Rv2623
contributes
to
growth
regulation
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
a
nucleotide
-
binding
USP
from
M
.
jannaschii
,
MJ0577
,
whose
ability
to
hydrolyze
ATP
is
dependent
on
interaction
with
factor
(
s
)
present
in
the
cell
extract
of
this
hyperthermophile
[
26
]
,
functions
as
a
molecular
switch
much
like
the
Ras
protein
family
,
whose
GTP
hydrolysis
ability
is
modulated
by
interaction
with
a
number
of
regulatory
proteins
[
53
]
,
[
54
]
,
[
55
]
.

The
fact
that
E
.
coli
-
expressed
Rv2623
co
-
purifies
with
ADP
as
well
as
ATP
suggests
the
possibility
that
this
mycobacterial
USP
,
like
MJ0577
,
is
capable
of
ATP
hydrolysis
.

Experiments
designed
to
investigate
the
potential
ATP
-
hydrolyzing
activity
of
Rv2623
are
currently
underway
.

A
Novel

for

Pseudomonas

Biofilm

The
important
human
pathogen
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
has
been
linked
to
numerous
biofilm
-
related
chronic
infections
.

These
two
-
component
systems
become
sequentially
phosphorylated
during
biofilm
formation
.

Inactivation
of

,

and

stages
,
respectively
,
as
indicated
by
analyses
of
biofilm
architecture
,
and
protein
and
phosphoprotein
patterns
.

Interestingly
,
inactivation
did
not
affect
planktonic

,
polysaccharide

,
or

.

Introduction

Biofilms
form
when
bacteria
adhere
to
surfaces
in
moist
environments
.

Biofilm
-
associated
microorganisms
have
been
shown
to
colonize
a
wide
variety
of
medical
devices
and
have
been
implicated
in
over
80
%
of
chronic
inflammatory
and
infectious
diseases
including
chronic
otitis
media
,
native
valve
endocarditis
,
gastrointestinal
ulcers
,
urinary
tract
and
middle
ear
infections
,
and
chronic
lung
infections
in
cystic
fibrosis
(
CF
)
patients
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
.

In
addition
,
P
.
aeruginosa
causes
a
variety
of
diseases
in
individuals
predisposed
to
infections
as
the
result
of
severe
burns
,
wounds
,
urinary
tract
or
corneal
injury
,
or
immunocompromised
status
[
5
]
-
[
8
]
.

This
is
supported
by
the
finding
that
various
microorganisms
,
including
P
.
aeruginosa
have
been
shown
to
form
biofilms
in
a
stage
-
specific
and
coordinated
manner
.

Vallet
et
al
.

In
contrast
,
type
IV
pili
and
flagella
deletion
mutants
exhibited
reduced
attachment
indicating
that
attachment
and
biofilm
formation
are
mediated
by
extracellular
appendages
[
12
]
,
[
15
]
-
[
17
]
.

These
are
the
wsp
chemosensory
signal
transduction
pathway
[
25
]
and
a
genetic
pathway
composed
of
the
phosphodiesterase
BifA
,
the
inner
membrane
-
localized
diguanylate
cyclase
SadC
and
the
cytoplasmic
protein
SadB
[
20
]
,
[
21
]
,
[
33
]
.

Both
are
involved
in
the
reciprocal
cyclic
-
di
-
GMP
-
dependent
regulation
of
Pel
and
Psl
exopolysaccharide
production
as
P
.
aeruginosa
transitions
from
a
planktonic
to
a
surface
associated
lifestyle
.

Both
Pel
and
Psl
exopolysaccharides
contribute
to
the
overall
architecture
of
biofilms
and
are
essential
for
surface
interaction
and
biofilm
initiation
[
34
]
,
[
35
]
.

Expression
of
the
pel
and
psl
genes
is
coordinated
by
the
global
regulator
RetS
,
a
hybrid
sensor
kinase
-
response
regulator
protein
,
that
plays
a
key
role
in
the
reciprocal
regulation
of
virulence
factors
and
biofilm
formation
required
for
acute
versus
chronic
infection
[
36
]
.

This
multi
-
component
switch
thus
orchestrates
the
transition
from
the
planktonic
to
the
biofilm
mode
of
growth
by
P
.
aeruginosa
via
phosphorylation
events
of
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
GacA
/
GacS
[
36
]
-
[
38
]
.

This
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
transition
to
later
stages
of
biofilm
formation
,
which
coincide
with
distinct
phenotypes
compared
to
planktonic
and
initial
attached
bacterial
cells
,
also
involves
sensing
of
environmental
signal
(
s
)
and
requires
the
coordinated
transduction
of
phosphorylation
events
(
phosphorelays
)
.

Furthermore
,
we
report
the
identification
of
three
novel
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
named
BfiRS
(
PA4196
-
4197
)
,
BfmRS
(
PA4101
-
4102
)
,
and
MifRS
(
PA5511
-
5512
)
that
coordinate
phosphorylation
events
required
for
the
progression
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
in
a
stage
-
specific
manner
.

The
formation
of
biofilms
has
been
proposed
to
be
controlled
in
response
to
environmental
signals
[
39
]
.

Given
that
protein
phosphorylation
is
a
common
modification
system
used
in
signal
transduction
that
changes
the
function
of
proteins
in
response
to
environmental
stimuli
[
38
]
,
we
chose
a
phosphoproteomic
approach
for
the
detection
and
identification
of
regulatory
pathways
active
following
the
transition
to
the
surface
attached
mode
of
growth
.

analyzed
for
the
presence
of
planktonic
-
and
biofilm
-
specific
phosphorylation
events
.

Additional
stage
-
specific
events
were
detected
for
biofilms
differing
in
age
.

For
instance
,
8
hr
and
24
hr
old
biofilms
displayed
23
and
21
phosphorylation
events
,
respectively
,
not
detected
at
any
other
stage
.

Regardless
of
the
biofilm
developmental
stage
,
7
phosphorylation
events
were
detected
that
were
absent
in
planktonic
cells
(
Fig
.
1A
,
biofilm
-
specific
events
)
.

In
both
modes
of
growth
,
26
proteins
were
constitutively
phosphorylated
.

In
addition
to
biofilm
stage
-
specific
phosphorylation
of
proteins
,
protein
phosphorylation
events
were
detectable
at
more
than
one
biofilm
growth
stage
indicating
that
the
transition
to
surface
-
associated
growth
coincides
with
distinct
protein
phosphorylation
and
dephosphorylation
events
.

As
shown
in
Fig
.

Furthermore
,
evidence
of
proteins
being
dephosphorylated
over
the
course
of
biofilm
formation
was
detected
.

Multiple
proteins
were
found
to
be
dephosphorylated
at
either
a
single
or
at
multiple
stages
over
the
course
of
biofilm
formation
and
maturation
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.

The
reduced
similarity
in
phosphorylation
events
between
biofilms
and
planktonic
cells
was
mainly
due
to
biofilm
specific
phosphorylation
events
detected
at
one
or
more
stages
of
development
.

Dispersion

biofilms
(

shared
43
%
similarity
with
the
phosphorylation
patterns
of
planktonically

grown
P
.
aeruginosa
cells
(
not

)
.

Similarly
to
the
results
obtained
via
immunoblot
analysis
,
the
changes
in
phosphorylation
events
over
the
course
of
biofilm
development
detected
using
LC
-
MS
-
MS
analysis
appeared
to
be
stage
-
specific
(
two
examples
are
shown
in

Fig

)
,
with
the
similarity
to
the
planktonic
patterns
decreasing
from
72
%
in
8
hr
biofilms
to
38
%
in
144
hr
biofilms
(
Fig
.
1C
)
.

The
overall
stage
-
specific
(
de
)
phosphorylation
events
as
well
as
the
differences
in
the
phosphoproteome
were
similar
to
those
detected
by
immunoblot
analysis
using
anti
-
Ser
/
Thr
antibodies
.

This
is
the
first
description
of
the
dynamic
changes
of
the
phosphoproteome
occurring
during
biofilm
development
.

Identification
of
regulatory
proteins
involved
in
sensing
environmental
signals
associated
with
planktonic
and
biofilm
growth

Fig
.

We
thus
identified
48
proteins
that
were
differentially
phosphorylated
at
one
or
more
biofilm
developmental
stage
including
elongation
factors
,
ribosomal
proteins
,
several
enzymes
including
reductases
and
GMP
synthase
,
sigma
factor
RpoD
(
Suppl
.
Table
S1
)
and
11
regulatory
proteins
(
Table
1
)
.

The
majority
of
regulatory
proteins
found
to
be
uniquely
phosphorylated
during
planktonic
growth
were
transcriptional
regulators
,
while
with
the
exception
of
PA2096
,
all
regulatory
proteins
found
to
be
phosphorylated
during
surface
attached
growth
were
identified
as
belonging
to
two
-
component
systems
(
TCS
)
(
Table
1
)
.

The
reason
for
the
difference
in
the
timing
of
phosphorylation
between
sensor
and
response
regulator
is
unclear
.

The
probable
TCS
regulatory
protein
PA5511
(
MifR
)
was
phosphorylated
following
72
hr
of
surface
-
associated
growth
.

Neither
the
cognate
sensory
protein
PA5512
nor
the
response
regulator
PA4196
were
identified
in
this
study
.

As
PA4197
,
PA4101
and
GacS
were
all
phosphorylated
by
24
hr
of
biofilm
growth
,
we
asked
whether
the
three
proteins
are
modified
simultaneously
or
in
a
sequential
manner
.

DeltagacS
biofilm
phosphorylation
patterns
showed
an
intermediate
phosphorylation
phenotype
with
PA4197
being
phosphorylated
but
PA4101
phosphorylation
lacking
(
not
shown
)
.

PA5511
was
not
detected
in
any
of
the
mutant
biofilms
analyzed
(
Suppl
.
Fig
.
S3
)
.

The
findings
suggest
that
phosphorylation
of
regulatory
proteins
occurs
in
a
sequential
(
but
probably
indirect
)
manner
over
the
course
of
biofilm
formation
.

PA4101
expression
was
detected
to
be
biofilm
-
specific
,
while
PA4197
and
PA5511
were
constitutively
expressed
regardless
of
the
mode
of
growth
(
Suppl
.
Fig
.
S4
)
.

We
therefore
focused
on
biofilm
-
specific
regulatory
proteins
.

Under
the
conditions
tested
,
wild
type
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
reached
maturity
following
144
hr
of
growth
as
characterized
by
biofilms
being
composed
of
large
microcolonies
exceeding
100
microm
in
diameter
(
Fig
.
2A
)
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
PA4197
mutant
biofilms
,
PA4101
mutant
biofilms
demonstrated
the
formation
of
some
cellular
aggregates
which
were
less
than
10
microm
in
height
(
Fig
.
2B
)
.

Complementation
of
both
PA4101
and
PA4197
mutants
restored
biofilm
formation
to
wild
type
levels
(
Fig
.
2C
,
Table
2
)
.

These
results
allowed
us
to
firmly
conclude
that
the
mutant
biofilm
phenotypes
are
caused
by
a
defect
in
the
PA4197
and
PA4101
ORF
.

Based
on
the
role
of
PA4197
in
the
initiation
of
biofilm
formation
,
we
named
the
PA4197
ORF
Biofilm
initiation
Sensor
(
BfiS
)
.

BfiS
is
an
unusual
sensor
that
harbors
a
His
kinase
A
domain
typically
found
in
two
-
component
system
(
TCS
)
sensor
proteins
,
a
Histidine
kinase
-
like
ATPase
domain
involved
in
autophosphorylation
but
also
in
protein
dephosphorylation
events
,
and
a
PAS
signal
receiver
domain
[
53
]
.

The
cognate
response
regulator
BfiR
(
PA4196
)
harbors
a
CheY
-
like
signal
receiver
domain
and
a
LuxR
-
like
DNA
binding
domain
,
which
is
also
present
in
the
quorum
-
sensing
regulatory
proteins
LasR
,
RhlR
,
and
QscR
and
in
response
regulators
with
established
roles
in
biofilm
formation
(
GacA
,
RocA1
/
SadA
)
[
53
]
.

The
cognate
sensor
BfmS
(
PA4102
)
is
unusual
in
that
it
lacks
an
autophosphorylation
site
typically
found
in
sensor
kinases
[
53
]
.

As
shown
in
Table
1
,
the
probable
TCS
regulatory
protein
PA5511
was
phosphorylated
following
72
hr
of
surface
-
associated
growth
.

PA5511
mutant
biofilms
grown
for
144
hr
lacked
clusters
and
microcolonies
typically
found
in
wild
type
biofilms
following
72
-
144
hr
of
growth
(
Fig
.
2A
-
B
)
.

MifR
harbors
a
CheY
-
like
receiver
and
a
sigma
-
54
interaction
domain
[
53
]
.

The
protein
is
on
average
30
-
50
%
identical
to
known
P
.
aeruginosa
NtrC
-
like
enhancer
binding
proteins
including
PilR
,
FleQ
,
FleR
,
AlgB
,
CbrB
,
and
NtrC
[
53
]
,
[
54
]
.

The
cognate
sensor
(
MifS
,
PA5512
)
is
a
typical
sensor
kinase
harboring
both
a
His
kinase
A
and
a
His
kinase
-
like
ATPase
domain
[
53
]
.

Under
the
conditions
tested
,
the
biofilm
architecture
of
all
three
mutants
was
similar
to
the
biofilm
architecture
shown
in
Fig
.

In
addition
,
no
difference
in
transcript
abundance
,
as
determined
by
semi
-
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
,
of
genes
involved
in
Pel
and
Psl
polysaccharide
biosynthesis
compared
to
wild
type
was
detected
(
not
shown
)
.

However
,
a
DeltagacS
mutant
showed
10
-
fold
reduced
initial
attachment
compared
to
the
wild
type
(
not
shown
)
,
consistent
with
previous
findings
by
Parkins
and
colleagues
[
65
]
.

Since
MifR
was
detected
to
be
phosphorylated
following
72
hr
of
biofilm
growth
(
Table
1
)
,
our
findings
indicate
that
phosphorylation
of
MifR
is
essential
for
the
progression
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilms
from
the
maturation
-
1
stage
(
72
hr
)
to
the
maturation
-
2
stage
(
144
hr
)
.

To
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
DeltabfiS
,
DeltabfmR
,
and
DeltamifR
mutant
biofilms
may
have
disaggregated
prematurely
,
the
formation
of
mutant
biofilms
was
monitored
daily
by
confocal
microscopy
over
a
period
of
144
hr
.

The
DeltabfiS
and
DeltabfmR
biofilms
resembled
wild
type
biofilms
with
respect
to
biomass
and
overall
architecture
at
the
24
hr
time
point
(
see
Fig
.
2A
-
B
)
.

However
,
while
wild
type
biofilms
continued
to
mature
/
develop
upon
prolonged
incubation
(
see
Fig
.
2A
)
,
no
additional
biomass
accumulation
or
alteration
in
architecture
was
observed
for
DeltabfiS
and
DeltabfmR
biofilms
post
24
hr
of
growth
.

Furthermore
,
for
DeltamifR
biofilms
,
the
progression
of
biofilm
formation
was
indistinguishable
from
wild
type
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
formation
for
the
first
72
hr
of
growth
.

The
findings
clearly
indicate
that
inactivation
of
these
novel
regulatory
proteins
did
not
cause
biofilm
disaggregation
.

Instead
,
our
findings
suggested
that
the
mutant
biofilms
were
incapable
of
progressing
from
the
initial
attachment
stage
to
more
mature
biofilm
stages
.

Since
GacS
was
found
to
be
phosphorylated
in
a
BfiS
-
dependent
manner
following
8
hrs
of
growth
,
we
asked
whether
a
DeltagacS
mutant
forms
biofilms
similar
in
architecture
to
DeltabfiS
biofilms
.

At
both
time
points
,
DeltagacS
biofilms
not
only
exceeded
the
average
microcolony
size
typically
seen
for
wild
type
biofilms
of
the
same
age
,
but
also
the
biomass
and
thickness
of
wild
type
biofilms
at
more
mature
ages
(
Fig
.
3
,
Table
2
)
.

Continued
growth
for
more
than
72
hr
,
however
,
resulted
in
the
disaggregation
of
DeltagacS
mutant
biofilms
as
indicated
by
the
presence
of
large
,
detached
clusters
floating
in
the
bulk
liquid
,
and
a
significantly
reduced
attached
biofilm
biomass
and
biofilm
thickness
(
Fig
.
3
,
Table
2
)
.

These
findings
suggest
that
GacS
may
play
a
dual
role
in
regulating
biofilm
formation
,
which
in
turn
may
be
dependent
on
the
phosphorylation
status
of
GacS
(
Table
1
)
.

Mutant
biofilms
display
protein
and
phosphorylation
patterns
indicative
of
stage
-
specific
arrest
of
biofilm
development

Based
on
qualitative
and
quantitative
analyses
,
BfiS
(
PA4197
)
and
BfmR
(
PA4101
)
mutant
biofilm
architecture
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
arrested
biofilm
formation
following
initial
attachment
,
while
inactivation
of
MifR
(
PA5511
)
coincided
with
biofilms
impaired
in
microcolony
formation
at
the
maturation
-
1
stage
.

The
phosphoproteomes
were
analyzed
using
two
approaches
,
(
i
)
immunoblot
analysis
of
whole
biofilm
cell
extracts
and
(
ii
)
LC
-
MS
/
MS
analysis
in
conjunction
with
cICAT
labeling
following
MOAC
purification
.

This
is
in
contrast
to
the
phosphoproteome
of
144
-
hr
-
old
P
.
aeruginosa
wild
type
biofilms
,
which
was
62
-
65
%
different
from
that
of
planktonic
cells
(
Fig
.
4A
)
.

Furthermore
,
both
mutant
biofilms
failed
to
exhibit
phosphorylation
events
typically
observed
during
normal
biofilm
development
following
144
hr
of
growth
(
see
Fig
.
1
,
Suppl
.
Table
S2
)
.

Instead
,
DeltabfiS
biofilms
exhibited
stage
-
specific
phosphorylation
events
typically
detected
in
8
-
hr
-
and
24
-
hr
-
old
wild
type
biofilms
:
the
Ser
/
Thr
phosphoproteome
contained
15
out
of
23
phosphorylated
proteins
and
2
out
of
21
phosphorylated
proteins
that
are
specific
for
8
-
hr
-
and
24
-
hr
-
old
wild
type
biofilms
,
respectively
(
see
Fig
.
1
,
Suppl
.
Table
S2
)
.

Furthermore
,
DeltamifR
biofilms
exhibited
8
out
of
27
maturation
-
1
specific
protein
phosphorylation
events
,
and
only
16
out
of
37
maturation
-
2
phosphorylation
events
(
Suppl
.
Table
S2
,
see
Fig
.
1
)
.

DeltabfiS
biofilms
were
more
similar
to
24
-
hr
-
old
wild
type
biofilms
than
to
wild
type
biofilms
at
more
mature
stages
.

Based
on
analyses
of
biofilm
architecture
,
as
well
as
of
protein
production
and
phosphorylation
patterns
,
our
findings
indicate
that
DeltabfiS
biofilms
are
arrested
in
the
transition
from
reversible
to
the
irreversible
attachment
stage
(
8
hr
to
24
-
hr
-
old
biofilms
,
respectively
)
.

Inactivation
of
MifR
appeared
to
result
in
the
arrest
of
biofilm
development
in
the
transition
between
the
maturation
-
1
and
-
2
stages
(
72
to
144
hr
)
while
DeltabfmR
biofilms
were
arrested
in
the
transition
between
irreversible
attachment
to
maturation
-
1
stage
.

Expression
of
bfiS
,
bfmR
,
and
mifR
is
required
for
maintenance
of
normal
biofilm
architecture
while
loss
of
expression
results
in
biofilm
architecture
collapse

Our
observations
indicated
that
BfiS
(
PA4197
)
,
BfmR
(
PA4101
)
and
MifR
(
PA5511
)
are
essential
in
the
stage
-
specific
development
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
formation
.

To
determine
whether
these
regulatory
proteins
are
only
essential
during
biofilm
formation
or
are
also
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
established
biofilms
,
we
asked
whether
inactivation
of
these
regulatory
proteins
in
mature
biofilms
would
affect
biofilm
architecture
.

For
DeltabfiS
and
DeltabfmR
mutant
biofilms
,
biofilm
disaggregation
was
noticeable
as
early
as
24
hr
post
arabinose
removal
(
not
shown
)
.

The
collapse
was
apparent
by
significant
reduction
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
of
biofilm
variables
including
biofilm
biomass
and
thickness
,
which
further
decreased
upon
continued
incubation
(
Fig
.
5
,
Table
3
)
.

In
contrast
,
no
reduction
of
the
wild
type
biofilm
architecture
was
observed
(
Fig
.
5
,
Table
3
)
.

Discussion

Evidence
showing
that
biofilm
development
is
a
coordinated
series
of
events
coinciding
with
distinct
phenotypes
has
led
to
the
assumption
that
the
formation
of
biofilms
is
a
regulated
progression
[
11
]
,
[
12
]
,
[
66
]
.

However
,
biofilm
development
has
been
considered
to
be
distinct
from
other
developmental
processes
including
the
programmed
differentiation
seen
in
spore
formation
in
Bacillus
subtilis
or
fruiting
body
formation
in
Myxococcus
xanthus
[
11
]
,
mainly
because
no
regulatory
pathways
have
yet
been
identified
that
are
responsible
for
regulating
committed
steps
in
the
formation
of
biofilms
with
the
exception
of
attachment
.

In
this
study
we
describe
the
identification
and
initial
characterization
of
three
novel
two
-
component
systems
(
TCS
)
essential
in
regulating
three
committed
steps
in
biofilm
development
.

Mutation
in
these
regulatory
pathways
did
not
affect
initial
attachment
,
motility
,
or
Pel
and
Psl
polysaccharide
production
,
but
instead
arrested
biofilm
development
in
the
transition
from
reversible
to
irreversible
attachment
[
8
hr
to
24
hr
,
BfiRS
(
PA4196
-
4197
)
]
,
from
initial
attachment
to
the
maturation
-
1
stage
[
(
24
hr
to
72
hr
,
BfmRS
(
PA4101
-
4102
)
]
,
and
following
the
maturation
-
1
stage
[
72
hr
to
144
hr
,
MifRS
(
PA5511
-
5512
)
]
(
Fig
.
6
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
phosphorylation
of
these
two
-
component
systems
occurred
in
sequence
with
BfiS
being
phosphorylated
first
,
followed
by
GacS
,
and
lastly
,
MifR
(
Table
1
,
Fig
.
6
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
novel
TCS
systems
described
here
appear
to
be
linked
via
GacS
to
the
multicomponent
system
RetS
/
LadS
/
GacAS
/
RsmA
essential
for
regulating
the
switch
between
the
planktonic
and
the
sessile
mode
of
growth
.

Since
inactivation
of
each
TCS
system
resulted
in
altered
or
arrested
biofilms
which
failed
to
exhibit
stage
-
specific
protein
production
and
phosphorylation
events
(
Figs
.

,

,
Suppl
.
Table
S2
)
,
it
is
likely
that
the
mutant
biofilms
in
turn
do
not
produce
the
necessary
signal
(
s
)
to
activate
or
phosphorylate
TCS
system
(
s
)
that
are
further
downstream
.

Thus
,
it
is
likely
that
inactivation
of
one
TCS
system
(
in
)
directly
results
in
altered
or
arrested
phosphorylation
patterns
and
thus
,
lack
of
phosphorylation
of
downstream
TCS
systems
(
as
observed
here
)
.

This
is
even
more
important
as
this
biofilm
collapse
was
observed
under
two
different
nutritional
conditions
,
when
grown
on
minimal
medium
using
either
glutamate
or
citrate
as
a
sole
carbon
source
(
see
also

and

for
comparison
of
LB
and
glutamate

)
.

The
novelty
of
these
TCS
is
further
supported
by
the
finding
that
a
search
for
BfiS

and

a

These
results
are
consistent
with
the
idea
that
biofilm
development
by
P
.

is
orchestrated
by
a
regulatory
cascade
(
Fig
.

)
that
is
analogous
to
other
developmental
systems
including
spore
formation
in

or
fruiting

formation
in

,
requiring
the
consecutive
action
of
at
least
two
sigma
factors
and
three
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
in
response
to
environmental
signals
.

In
summary
,
we
have
evidence
of
three
novel
regulatory
systems
playing
a
role
in
the
progression
of
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
in
a
stage
-
specific
manner
.

While
our
study
did
not
result
in
the
identification
of
RetS
or
LadS
,
we
identified
GacS
by
two
different
approaches
and
confirmed
GacS
phosphorylation
by
immunoblot
analysis
(
Table
1
)
.

GacS
acts
as
a
suppressor
of
RetS
(
and
vice
versa
)
with
RetS
regulating
the
suppressor
activity
of
the
membrane
-
bound
sensor
GacS
by
directly
modulating
its
phosphorylation
state
[
38
]
.

The
finding
is
consistent
with
our
observation
of
GacS
playing
a
dual
role
in
biofilm
formation
,
with
phosphorylation
acting
as
a
switch
in
the
function
of
GacS
(
Fig
.
3
,
Table
2
)
:
GacS
participates
in
the
planktonic
/
biofilm
switch
in
its
non
-
phosphorylated
state
,
but
limits
/
regulates
the
rate
of
biomass
accumulation
and
biofilm
development
when
phosphorylated
.

Since
phosphorylation
of
GacS
occurred
following
8
hr
of
surface
attached
growth
(
Table
1
)
and
since
RetS
directly
modulates
the
phosphorylation
state
of
GacS
[
38
]
,
the
findings
may
suggest
that
RetS
only
remains
functional
for
a
period
of
8
hours
during
initial
attachment
after
which
RetS
is
rendered
non
-
functional
.

Furthermore
,
the
finding
of
sequential
and
essential
regulatory
steps
in
biofilm
formation
and
the
involvement
of
at
least
two
sigma
factors
suggests
that
biofilm
development
is
analogous
to
other
programmed
developmental
processes
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
known
developmental
processes
,
our
findings
suggest
that
both
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
and
sigma
factor
dependent
response
regulators
are
key
components
of
the
transcriptional
and
regulatory
machinery
that
coordinate
gene
expression
during
P
.
aeruginosa
biofilm
development
.

A
suite
of
T3SS

chaperone
proteins
bind
cargo
in
the
bacterial
cytosol
,
establishing
protein
interaction
networks
needed
for
effector

into

.

In
Salmonella

serovar
Typhimurium
,
a
T3SS
encoded
in
a
large
genomic
island
(
SPI

)
is
required
for

,
but
the
chaperone
complement
required
for
effector
translocation
by
this
system
is
not
known
.

Crystallographic
analysis
of
SrcA
at
a
resolution
of

A
revealed
a
dimer
similar
to
the
CesT
chaperone
from
enteropathogenic
E

coli
but
lacking
a
17
-
amino
acid
extension
at
the
carboxyl
terminus
.

Further
biochemical
and
quantitative
proteomics
data
revealed
three
protein
interactions
with
SrcA
,
including
two
effector
cargos
(
SseL
and
PipB2
)
and
the
type
III

that
increases
the

of

.

Introduction

Many
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
that
colonize
host
animals
use
a
type
III
secretion
system
(
T3SS
)
to
deliver
effector
proteins
directly
into
host
cells
where
their
interaction
with
host
proteins
and
membranes
contribute
to
pathogenesis
.

These
chaperones
often
have
common
physical
features
such
as
low
molecular
weight
(
<
15
kDa
)
,
an
acidic
isoelectric
point
and
a
predicted
amphipathic
helix
at
the
carboxyl
terminus
.

Class
I
chaperones
bind
to
translocated
effector
proteins
at
a
chaperone
binding
domain
(
CBD
)
located
in
the
amino
terminus
of
the
effector
.

Class
II
chaperones
bind
to
translocon
proteins
that
make
up
the
secretion
pore
in
the
host
target
membrane
and
class
III
chaperones
bind
the
extracellular
filament
proteins
(
or
flagellin
rod
in
the
orthologous
flagellar
system
)
that
polymerize
into
a
helical
structure
following
secretion
from
the
bacterial
cell
.

To
date
,
13
effectors
have
been
identified
as
substrates
of
the
SPI
-
1
T3SS
and
21
effectors
for
the
SPI
-
2
T3SS
,
although
the
chaperones
orchestrating
the
latter
system
have
been
elusive
.

Whereas
80
%
of
the
effectors
of
the
SPI
-
1
system
have
defined
chaperones
,
only
two
effector
-
chaperone
interactions
are
known
for
the
SPI
-
2
system
.

These
include
the
effector
-
chaperone
pair
of
SseF
-
SscB
,
and
the
chaperone
SseA
that
binds
translocon
components
SseD
and
SseB
[
8
]
,
[
9
]
,
[
10
]
.

Crystal
structures
have
been
determined
for
three
chaperones
that
coordinate
translocation
of
effectors
through
the
SPI
-
1
T3SS
(
InvB
[
11
]
,
SicP
[
12
]
and
SigE
[
13
]
)
.

However
no
structures
are
available
for
the
SPI
-
2
T3SS
chaperones
whose
effector
repertoire
seems
considerably
larger
than
that
of
the
SPI
-
1
system
.

These
data
reveal
structural
and
biochemical
insight
into
a
T3SS
secretion
chaperone
required
for
intracellular
pathogenesis
of
Salmonella
.

Results

This
gene
was
also
down
regulated
in
Salmonella
mutants
lacking
the
SsrA
sensor
kinase
[
20
]
,
and
was
predicted
to
encode
a
possible
chaperone
in
a
bioinformatics
-
based
screen
[
23
]
.

The
srcA
gene
is
not
located
in
the
vicinity
of
the
T3SS
encoded
by
SPI
-
2
(
STM1378
-
STM1425
)
,
but
is
713
genes
downstream
on
the
chromosome
(
STM
numbers
are
based
on
the
LT2
genome
and
ordered
sequentially
on
the
chromosome
beginning
at
STM0001
,
thrL
)
.

This
analysis
revealed
a
strong
SsrB
binding
site
spanning
10
syntenic
probes
within
the
intergenic
region
(
IGR
)
upstream
of
srcA
,
that
together
with
the
transcriptional
data
corroborated
a
direct
regulatory
role
for
SsrB
on
srcA
expression
(
Fig
.
1A
)
.

In
whole
cell
lysates
,
SrcA
protein
was
reduced
approximately10
-
fold
in
DeltassrB
cells
compared
to
wild
type
(
Fig
.
1B
)
and
the
protein
was
not
detected
in
the
secreted
fraction
from
wild
type
cells
(
Fig
.
1C
)
,
consistent
with
the
expected
properties
of
a
T3SS
chaperone
.

SrcA
contributes
to
Salmonella
fitness
in
an
animal
host

Most
SsrB
-
regulated
gene
products
contribute
to
the
intracellular
survival
of
Salmonella
in
a
host
.

In
comparative
genomics
analyses
,
srcA
was
found
in
all
virulent
strains
of
Salmonella
enterica
containing
SPI
-
2
,
but
was
absent
from
the
cold
-
blooded
animal
commensal
,
S
.
bongori
,
which
lacks
SPI
-
2
(
Table
S1
)
.

The
level
of
attenuation
of
the
srcA
mutant
was
generally
higher
than
most
single
effector
gene
mutants
[
26
]
,
which
suggested
to
us
that
SrcA
contributes
to
an
important
aspect
of
T3SS
function
in
vivo
.

Crystal
structure
of
SrcA

The
structure
was
solved
by
molecular
replacement
using
an
initial
model
based
on
CesT
(
PDB
1K3E
)
[
13
]
.

SrcA
crystallized
in
space
group
C2
with
two
molecules
related
by
a
2
-
fold
symmetry
axis
in
each
asymmetric
unit
(
Fig
.
2B
)
.

The
smaller
domain
formed
by
alpha1
and
the
extended
loop
region
preceding
beta1
adopts
a
distinct
conformation
in
each
subunit
.

A
structure
similarity
search
with
SrcA
revealed
proteins
identified
as
T3SS
secretion
chaperones
.

CesT
and
SicP
were
the
most
structurally
similar
to
SrcA
,
aligning
with
RMSD
of
1
.
8
A
and
2
.
2
A
respectively
.

With
the
exception
of
CesT
,
SrcA
has
weak
overall
sequence
identity
(
<
20
%
)
with
other
T3SS
chaperones
.

Most
of
these
conserved
sites
are
located
in
the
alpha2
-
interface
helix
and
in
strands
beta4
and
beta5
that
help
stabilize
this
interface
.

Although
the
N
-
terminus
of
these
proteins
is
conserved
structurally
,
the
tertiary
structures
differ
for
each
protein
.

In
CesT
,
alpha1
and
beta1
adopt
an
extended
conformation
while
the
equivalent
domain
in
SicP
remains
closely
packed
against
the
dimerization
domain
[
12
]
.

A
comparison
of
the
SrcA
dimer
interface
with
other
class
I
chaperone
family
members
indicates
the
overall
similarity
of
quaternary
structure
shared
between
SrcA
,
CesT
and
SicP
(
Fig
.
3A
)
.

This
is
in
contrast
to
the
class
II
chaperone
interface
of
Spa15
,
which
despite
having
similar
tertiary
structure
to
SrcA
adopts
a
distinct
dimer
interface
.

A
structural
alignment
of
SrcA
and
Spa15
generated
through
alignment
of
single
monomers
shows
the
relative
difference
in
subunit
orientation
between
SrcA
and
Spa15
reflected
by
the
positions
of
each
monomer
in
the
dimer
configuration
.

These
unique
orientations
produce
an
80degrees
rotational
offset
between
respective
subunits
and
could
be
expected
to
influence
the
mode
of
effector
interactions
utilized
by
these
proteins
.

Binding
of
SptP
occurs
primarily
in
the
N
-
terminus
of
SicP
[
12
]
,
which
is
similar
to
the
effector
binding
surface
for
SrcA
predicted
in
silico
.

To
address
this
biochemically
we
purified
SrcA
and
the
predicted
ATPase
for
the
SPI
-
2
T3SS
,
SsaN
,
and
performed
binding
experiments
and
gel
filtration
chromatography
of
the
protein
mixtures
.

SsaN
contains
conserved
amino
acid
residues
characteristic
of
Walker
-
A
and
Walker
-
B
motifs
of
P
-
loop
nucleoside
triphosphate
hydrolases
,
as
well
as
a
number
of
residues
shown
to
contribute
to
ATP
binding
or
ring
stacking
with
the
adenine
base
of
ATP
in
the
E
.
coli
orthologue
,
EscN
,
(
Q412
,
E191
,
R366
)
(
Fig
.
S1
)
.

When
SrcA
was
mixed
with
SsaN
,
a
new
protein
complex
of
high
molecular
weight
was
observed
,
along
with
diminished
peaks
corresponding
to
the
SrcA
dimer
and
SsaN
monomer
(
Fig
.
4C
)
.

This
new
complex
elutes
with
a
Stokes
radius
consistent
with
an
apparent
molecular
mass
of
approximately600
kDa
.

SrcA
binds
effector
cargo
destined
for
the
SPI
-
2
T3SS

First
,
we
used
stable
isotope
labeling
of
amino
acids
in
cell
culture
(
SILAC
)
[
28
]
in
conjunction
with
quantitative
mass
spectrometry
-
based
proteomics
to
identify
cargo
immunoprecipitated
with
SrcA
from
Salmonella
.

For
this
series
of
experiments
we
constructed
a
mutant
in
which
the
srcA
gene
was
replaced
on
the
chromosome
with
srcA
-
FLAG
to
enable
immunoprecipitation
from
cell
lysates
.

Peptides
originating
from
wild
type
cells
contained
heavy
atom
-
substituted
lysine
and
arginine
such
that
putative
SrcA
cargo
proteins
would
generate
low
heavy
:
light
SILAC
peptide
ratios
from
the
complex
mixtures
(
Fig
.
5A
)
.

SseL
was
immunoprecipitated
specifically
along
with
SrcA
-
FLAG
with
a
SILAC
ratio
of
0
.
08
,
whereas
additional
abundant
proteins
displayed
SILAC
ratios
closer
to
approximately1
(
OmpF
is
shown
,
Fig
.
5B
)
(
mean
SILAC
ratio
of
all
other
peptides
identified
was
0
.
93
(
Dataset
S1
)
.

Secondly
,
to
verify
the
mass
spectrometry
data
and
to
identify
other
possible
effector
cargo
,
we
examined
the
secretion
profiles
of
wild
type
cells
and
an
srcA
mutant
that
each
expressed
HA
-
tagged
effector
genes
,
the
products
of
which
are
secreted
by
the
SPI
-
2
-
encoded
T3SS
.

Using
this
approach
SseL
-
HA
and
PipB2
-
HA
were
depleted
from
the
secreted
protein
fraction
of
srcA
mutant
cells
(
Fig
.
5C
)
but
reached
similar
levels
in
the
bacterial
cytoplasm
(
Fig
.
5D
)
.

As
expected
from
data
with
the
complemented
mutant
in
vivo
,
expression
of
srcA
in
trans
restored
effector
secretion
in
the
srcA
mutant
(
data
not
shown
)
.

SrcA
is
required
for
PipB2
-
dependent
centrifugal
displacement
of
the
Salmonella
-
containing
vacuole

To
further
show
a
role
for
SrcA
in
chaperoning
PipB2
,
we
set
up
experiments
to
test
whether
deleting
srcA
would
phenocopy
DeltapipB2
cells
for
PipB2
-
dependent
centrifugal
displacement
of
the
Salmonella
containing
vacuole
(
SCV
)
in
epithelial
cells
,
an
event
linked
to
cell
-
to
-
cell
transfer
during
infection
in
vitro
[
29
]
.

By
24
h
after
infection
SCVs
containing
wild
type
bacteria
were
displaced
centrifugally
towards
the
cell
periphery
whereas
SCVs

Typhimurium
that
is
integrated
functionally
with
the
T3SS

,
a
system
well
described
for
its
role
in
immune
subversion
and
intracellular
infection
during
host
colonization
.

Consistent
with
other
class
I
secretion
chaperones
,
SrcA
has
extensive
electronegative
charge
distributed
over
the
surface
of
the
molecule
.

The
exact
function
of
this
charge
distribution
is
not
known
,
but
data
from
other
systems
suggests
a
docking
recognition
function
with
other
components
of
the
type
III
apparatus
,
possibly
the
T3SS
-
accociated
ATPase
.

For
instance
,
electronegative
surface
residues
on
the
SigE
chaperone
in
the
SPI
-
1
-
encoded
T3SS
negatively
affect
cargo
secretion
,
but
not
cargo
stability
[

]
.

In
enteropathogenic
E
.
coli
,
a
surface
-
exposed
electronegative
residue
in
the
CesT
chaperone
(
Glu142
)
likewise
contributes
to
Tir
secretion
but
not
Tir
binding
[
16
]
,
suggesting
a
role
in
either
targeting
bound
cargo
to
the
T3SS
or
in
the
secretion
process
itself
.

Thus
,
it
is
likely
that
other
surface
charged
residues
of
SrcA
are
involved
in
these
functions
or
that
SrcA
targets
effector
cargo
to
the
secretion
apparatus
through
a
mechanism
distinct
from
CesT
.

The
interface
for
the
SrcA
homodimer
is
extensive
and
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
structural
features
of
single
-
effector
class
IA
chaperones
(
approximately1100
-
1300
A2
)
compared
to
the
reduced
dimer
interface
of
Spa15
,
a
multi
-
cargo
class
IB
chaperone
from
Shigella
[
31
]
.

Similar
to
CesT
and
SicP
,
the
dimer
interface
of
SrcA
adopts
a
parallel
configuration
when
comparing
alpha2
helices
of
opposing
subunits
.

In
contrast
,
the
subunits
of
Spa15
undergo
a
significant
relative
rotation
(
80degrees
)
about
the
alpha2
-
axis
resulting
in
a
different
interface
.

These
features
may
relate
to
biological
function
in
the
SPI2
T3SS
and
/
or
in
vetting
effector
cargo
amongst
the
>
30
effectors
identified
in
Salmonella
.

Implications
for
type
III
secretion
function

The
interaction
between
SrcA
and
SsaN
supports
an
emerging
paradigm
whereby
secretion
chaperones
bring
effector
cargo
to
the
T3SS
through
physical
interaction
with
the
hexameric
ATPase
at
the
base
of
the
apparatus
[
14
]
.

Our
work
shows
the
first
chaperone
-
ATPase
interaction
for
a
T3SS
functioning
from
within
an
intracellular
vacuolar
compartment
and
supports
this
interaction
as
a
more
generalize
feature
of
type
III
secretion
function
.

Conversely
,
these
genes
are
absent
from
S
.
bongori
,
which
lacks
the
SPI
-

-
encoded
T3SS
.

The
expression
of
srcA
is
coordinated
with
T3SS
transcriptional
activity
via
the
SsrA
-
SsrB
two
-
component
regulatory
system
encoded
in
SPI
-

.

Due
to
low
G

C
base
content
compared
to
the
genome
average
of
52
%
,
it
'
s
likely
that
srcA
(
32
%
G
+
C
)
and
an
adjacent
gene
,
STM2137
(
37
%
G

C
)
,
were
acquired
as
a
foreign
islet
that
was
retained
in
organisms
containing
the
SPI
-
2
T3SS
due
to
the
selective
advantage
afforded
by
the
new
protein
interactions
so
created
.

SseK2
is
also
regulated
by
the
SsrA

SsrB
two
-
component
system
but
compared
to
SseK1
,
it
is
translocated
in
much
less
abundance
into
host
cells
[
33
]
.

Given
its
genetic
neighborhood
,
srcA
appears
to
be
a
genetic
acquisition
separate
from
SPI
-
2
that
functionally
links
some
effectors
to
the
T3SS
apparatus
via
the
ATPase
.

The
role
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
and
regulatory
evolution
in
allowing
for
uncoupling
of
chaperones
,
effectors
and
the
T3SS
has
many
possible
implications
for
T3SS
function
,
including
plasticity
in
chaperone
-
effector
interaction
networks
,
expansion
of
effector
repertoires
,
and
alterations
to
the
kinetics
and
hierarchical
delivery
of
effectors
to
a
host
cell
.

These
events
may
improve
host
adaptability
or
even
expand
the
host
range
of
bacteria
that
acquire
and
integrate
new
functional
secretion
chaperones

Transit

Y

pestis
exhibits
a
distinct
life
stage
in
the
flea
,
where
it
grows
in
the
form
of
a
cohesive
biofilm
that
promotes
transmission
.

These
factors
are
not
produced
in
the
low
-
temperature
environment
of
the
flea
,
however
,
suggesting
that
Y
.
pestis
is
vulnerable
to
the
initial
encounter
with
innate

cells
at
the
flea
bite
site
.

Y
.
pestis
from
infected
fleas
were
more
resistant
to
phagocytosis
by
macrophages
than
in

-
grown
bacteria
,
in
part
attributable
to
a
cluster
of
insecticidal
-
like
toxin
genes
that
were
highly
expressed
only
in
the

.

Our

suggest
that

induces
a

that
enhances
survival
and

of
Y

pestis
after

to
the
mammalian

.

To
date
,
only
three
transmission
factors
(
genes
specifically
required
to
produce
a
transmissible
infection
in
the
flea
)
have
been
characterized
.

After
being
taken
up
in
a
blood
meal
,
Y
.
pestis
proliferates
in
the
lumen
of
the
flea
midgut
to
form
cohesive
multicellular
biofilm
aggregates
.

In
some
infected
fleas
,
the
proventricular
valve
between
the
midgut
and
esophagus
is
colonized
.

Fleas
with
a
completely
blocked
proventriculus
make
prolonged
,
repeated
attempts
to
feed
,
increasing
the
opportunities
for
transmission
.

Formation
of
a
Y
.
pestis
biofilm
in

and
in
the
flea
proventriculus
depends
on
synthesis
of
an
extracellular

matrix
(
ECM
)
that
is
synthesized
only
at
temperatures
below
26degreesC
[

,
[

]
.

Bacterial
adhesins
are
typically
required
for
initial

and

in
biofilm
development
[

]
,
but
such
factors
have
yet
to
be
identified
in
Y
.
pestis
.

In
a
previous
study
,
we
reported
the
in

gene
expression
profile
of
Y
.
pestis
during
bubonic
plague
in
rats
[
11
]
.

In
addition
,
comparing
the
gene
expression
patterns
in
the
flea
and
in
the
rat
bubo
confirmed
that
distinct
subsets
of
genes
are
differentially
expressed
during
the
Y
.
pestis
life
cycle
.

Notably
,
several
genes
with
known
or
predicted
roles
in
protection
against
the
mammalian
innate
immune
system
and
in
pathogenesis
were
upregulated
in
the
flea
,
suggesting
that
transit
through
the
insect
vector
preinduces
a
phenotype
that
enhances
Y

pestis
survival
and

in
the

Transcriptional
profile
of
Y
.
pestis
in
the
flea
Little
is
known
about
the
environmental
conditions
in
the
flea
digestive
tract
,
how
Y
.
pestis
adapts
to
them
,
or
the
physiological
state
of
the
bacteria
at
transmission
when
they
exit
the
flea
and
enter
the
mammal
.

Flea
proteases
,
lipases
,
and
other
digestive
enzymes
begin
to
process
the
blood
meal
in
the
midgut
immediately
after
feeding
,
yielding
amino
acids
and
peptides
,
glycerol
,
fatty
acids
,
and
simple
carbohydrates
[
12
]
.

During
the
first
week
after
being
ingested
in
an
infectious
blood
meal
,
Y
.
pestis
grows
rapidly
in
the
flea
midgut
to
form
large
bacterial
aggregates
.

Bacterial
load
peaks
at
about
106
cells
per
flea
as
the
Y
.
pestis
biofilm
accumulates
in
the
proventriculus
to
cause
blockage
,
and
then
plateaus
[

]
,
[

]
.

In
this
study
,
we
determined
the
Y
.
pestis
gene
expression
profile
in
infective
,
blocked
fleas
,
in
which
the
proventriculus
was
occluded
with
a
mature
bacterial
biofilm
.

Quantitative
RT
-
PCR
analysis
of
a
subset
of
Y
.
pestis
genes
differentially
expressed
in
the
flea
was
confirmatory
of
the
microarray
results
(
Fig
.
S2
)
.

Of
the
214
genes
upregulated
in
the
flea
gut
compared
to
all
in
vitro
conditions
,
78
are
metabolic
genes
,
60
of
which
are
involved
in
uptake
and
catabolism
of
amino
acids
and
carbohydrates
(
Table
S1
)
.

The
degradation
of
these
amino
acids
gives
rise
to
L
-
glutamate
and
the
TCA
cycle
intermediates
succinate
,
formate
,
and
alpha
-
ketoglutarate
.

The
gabD
and
gabT
genes
involved
in
the
production
of
succinate
from
gamma
-
aminobutyrate
(
GABA
)
,
another
member
of
the
L
-
glutamate
group
,
were
also
highly
induced
in
the
flea
.

The
gabD
gene
functions
to
produce
succinate
from
both
GABA
and
hydroxyphenylacetate
(
HPA
)
,
an
aromatic
degradation
product
of
Tyr
and
Phe
;
and
the
HPA
transport
(
hpaX
)
and
catabolism
(
hpaCBIFHDE
)
genes
of
Y
.
pestis
were
also
highly
upregulated
in
the
flea
gut
(
Table
S1
,
Fig
.
2
)
.

As
Y
.
pestis
does
not
have
homologs
of
genes
required
to
produce
GABA
or
HPA
,
these
metabolites
may
be
taken
up
from
the
flea
digestive
tract
.

Alternatively
,
the
gabD
and
gabT
gene
products
might
act
in
the
reverse
direction
to
synthesize
GABA
,
which
has
osmoprotective
properties
[
13
]
.

Interestingly
,
both
glutamate
and
GABA
are
important
neurotransmitters
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
of
insects
,
and
the
concentration
of
glutamate
is
very
low
in
insect
hemolymph
,
suggesting
that
it
is
converted
to
glutamine
before
it
is
absorbed
[
14
]
.

Thus
,
Y
.
pestis
metabolism
in
the
flea
may
reflect
the
available
pool
of
amino
acids
in
the
midgut
.

Only
the
genes
encoding
for
chitobiose
phosphotransferase
(
PTS
)
uptake
and
utilization
systems
(
chbBC
;
chbF
)
,
and
for
a
PTS
system
of
unknown
specificity
(
frwBCD
)
were
significantly
upregulated
in
the
flea
[
16
]
,
[
17
]
.

Chitobiose
could
be
present
in
the
flea
gut
due
to
turnover
of
the
chitin
layer
on
the
proventricular
spines
.

Expression
of
the
glucose
PTS
system
was
only
slightly
increased
relative
to
LB
cultures
,
and
other
PTS
systems
were
downregulated
(
Table
S2
)
.

Glycolytic
pathways
were
not
upregulated
in
the
flea
;
instead
,
available
hexoses
and
the
gluconeogenesis
pathway
may
be
used
to
synthesize
polysaccharide
components
required
for
cell
growth
.

Upregulation
of
the
actP
and
acs
genes
in
the
flea
,
which
direct
the
uptake
of
acetate
and
its
conversion
to
acetyl
-
CoA
,
also
suggests
that
insufficient
acetyl
-
CoA
is
produced
by
glycolysis
to
potentiate
the
TCA
cycle
.

The
switch
from
acetate
secretion
to
acetate
uptake
is
typical
of
growth
in
a
glucose
-
limited
,
amino
acid
rich
environment
[
18
]
.

In
contrast
to
hexose
uptake
systems
,
Y
.
pestis
genes
that
encode
permeases
for
the
pentoses
ribose
,
xylose
,
and
arabinose
were
induced
in
the
flea
gut
.

Acquisition
of
pentoses
from
the
environment
may
be
important
because
Y
.
pestis
does
not
possess
glucose
6
-
phosphate
dehydrogenase
activity
,
the
first
step
of
the
pentose
phosphate
pathway
[
19
]
.

None
of
the
fatty
acid
uptake
or
catabolism
genes
were
upregulated
in
the
flea
compared
to
growth
in
LB
.

However
,
genes
for
glycerol
and
glycerol
-
3
-
phosphate
uptake
and
utilization
were
upregulated
,
suggesting
that
flea
digestion
products
derived
from
blood
glycerolipids
may
be
used
by
Y
.
pestis
.

Amino
acid
carbon
is
presumably
funneled
into
the
TCA
cycle
,
the
genes
for
which
are
highly
expressed
in
the
flea
(

.

Y

pestis
genes
involved
in
infection
and
biofilm
formation
in
the
flea

Several
studies
comparing
the
transcriptional
profiles
of
Escherichia
coli
and
other
gram
negative
bacteria
during
biofilm
and
planktonic
growth
in

have
been
published
[
20
]
,
[
21
]
,
[
22
]
,
[
23
]
.

However
,
Y
.
pestis
is
constitutively
nonmotile
,
and
synthesis
of
the
Hms
-
dependent
biofilm
ECM
is
regulated
post

translationally
[
26
]
.

In
addition
to
yidE
and
cpxP
,
other
Y
.
pestis
predicted
adhesins
and
components
of
an
ESR
were
upregulated
in
the
flea
.

The
Y

pestis
homologs
of
Pseudomonas

cupA1
and
cupA3
in
a

fimbrial

operon
and
yapL
,
a

autotransporter
adhesin
similar
to
E
.

tibA
,
were
specifically
upregulated
in
the
flea
(
Table
S1
)
.

The
cupA
fimbrial
locus
and
tibA
are
important
for
surface
adherence
and
for
biofilm
formation
in
P
.
aeruginosa
and
E
.

,
respectively
[
28
]
,
[
29
]
.

These
genes
were
also
found
to
be
upregulated
in
mature
E
.
coli
biofilms
[
23
]
,
suggesting
that
the
three
prominent
ESR
systems
are
important
for
integrating
signals
required
for
survival
in
a
biofilm
.

Because
homologs
of
the
yidE
,
cpxP
,
tibA
(
yapL
)
,
cupA
fimbriae
,
and
pspABC
genes
were
upregulated
in
the
flea
and
have
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
biofilm
formation
in
other
bacteria
[
23
]
,
[
27
]
,
[
28
]
,
[
29
]
,
we
made
a
series
of
Y
.
pestis
strains
containing
deletions
of
these
loci
.

However
,
the
single
loss
of
any
of
these
genes
did
not
result
in
a
noticeable
defect
in
biofilm
formation
in
vitro
,
or
in
flea
infection
or
blockage
(
data
not
shown
)
.

These
genes
may
contribute
to
biofilm
formation
,
but
are
not
individually
essential
for
this
phenotype
.

This
is
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
Y
.
pestis
is
able
to
synthesize
polyamines
de
novo
.

not
been

so
the
inducing
stimulus
is
unknown
,
but
CAMPs
are
induced
and
secreted
into
the
gut
by
blood
feeding
insects
when
they
take
a
blood
meal
containing

[

,
[

X

cheopis
fleas
encode
homologs
of
the
insect
CAMPs
cecropin
and
defensin
,
and
mount
an
inducible
antibacterial
response
to
infection
(
unpublished

)
.

Despite
the
upregulation
of
phoP
in
the
flea
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
mgtC
there
was
little
correlation
between
predicted
PhoP
-
regulated
genes
in
vitro
and
genes
upregulated
in
the
flea
[
39
]
,
[
46
]
,
[
47
]
.

Differential
regulation
of
members
of
the
PhoP
regulon
may
occur
depending
on
the
inducing
stimulus
,
however
[
48
]
.

Soon
after
transmission
,
Y
.
pestis
would
be
expected
to
encounter
rapidly
-
responding
phagocytic
cells
in
the
dermis
.

To
assess
the
overall
effect
of
the
flea
-
specific
phenotype
on
this
encounter
,
we
compared
the
interaction
of
Y
.
pestis
recovered
from
infected
fleas
and
from
in
vitro
cultures
with
murine
bone
marrow
macrophages
.

Bacteria
from
fleas
showed
significantly
lower
levels
of
phagocytosis
(
Fig
.
4A
)
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
genes
for
these
Tc
-
like
proteins
are
highly
expressed
in
fleas
,
but
that
their
products
are
nontoxic
to
fleas
[
49
]
.

yitR
,
a
LysR
-
type
regulator
that
activates
the
Tc
-
like
yit
genes
[
50
]
,
was
upregulated
>
10
-
fold
in
the
flea
,
but
its
expression
was
not
detected
in
the
rat
bubo
(
Table
1
)
.

The
specific
induction
in
the
flea
of
yitR
and
genes
in
the
adjacent
Tc
-
like
yit
and
yip
loci
suggests
that
they
are
involved
in
adaptation
to
and
colonization
of
the
flea
.

To
determine
if
the
insecticidal
-
like
toxins
were
involved
in
resistance
to
phagocytosis
,
we
repeated
the
macrophage
experiments
with
a
Y
.
pestis
DeltayitR
mutant
,
which
as
expected
showed
greatly
reduced
expression
of
the
yit
and
yip
genes
in
vitro
and
in
the
flea
(
Fig
.
4B
)
.

Loss
of
yitR
significantly
reduced
the
increased
resistance
to
phagocytosis
of
Y
.
pestis
isolated
from
infected
fleas
(
Fig
.
4C
)
.

On
average
,
the
mice
challenged
with
Y
.
pestis
DeltayitR
-
infected
fleas
,
both
those
that
developed
disease
and
those
that
did
not
,
received
a
higher
cumulative
number
of
bites
from
blocked
fleas
than
the
mice
challenged
with
Y
.
pestis
-
infected
fleas
,
but
this
difference
was
not
statistically
significant
(
Fig
.
5
)
.

Because
phoP
is
required
by
Y
.
pestis
to
produce
a
transmissible
infection
in
fleas
(
unpublished
data
)
,
it
was
not
possible
to
similarly
assess
the
effect
on
disease
transmission
of
phoP
induction
in
the
flea
.

Our
results
indicate
that
Y
.
pestis
entering
the
mammal
from
an
infective
flea
is
relatively
resistant
to
macrophages
,
as
well
as
PMNs
[
7
]
;
a
vector
-
specific
phenotype
that
is
not
related
to
the
T3SS
or
capsule
.

Finally
,
the
major
essential
virulence
factors
yadBC
and
pla
,
essential
for
Y
.
pestis
dissemination
from
the
dermis
,
were
maximally
or
very
highly
expressed
in
the
flea
(
Tables
1
,
S3
)
.

In
summary
,
Y
.
pestis
appears
to
be
prepared
for
pathogenesis
in
the
mammal
while
still
in
the
flea
vector
.

Increased
resistance
to
innate
immunity
that
is
preinduced
in
the
flea
vector
may
be
critical
to
productive
transmission
because
blocked
fleas
transmit
relatively
few
bacteria
,
often
below
the
LD50
of
Y
.
pestis
grown
in
vitro
at
<
28degreesC
[

]
,
[
52
]
.

Two
operons
,
the
phosphotransferase
system
and
the
maltose
transport
system
,
were
down
-
regulated
.

Ten
genes
related
with
carbon
metabolism
(
pckA
and
fumB
among
others
)
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
bvrR
mutant
,
and
denitrification
genes
(
nirK
,
norC
and
nosZ
)
were
also
regulated
.

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
were
affected
,
including
VjbR
,
ExoR
and
OmpR
that
were
less
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

These
regulatory
systems
are
highly
conserved
among
bacteria
and
widely
used
for
controlling
gene
expression
in
response
to
environmental
signals
.

In
response
to
stimuli
,
the
sensor
kinase
autophosphorylates
,
then
transfers
its
phosphate
to
its
cognate
response
regulator
to
control
the
transcription
of
target
genes
[
1
]
.

Up
to
now
,
BvrR
/
BvrS
is
the
best
characterized
two
-
component
regulatory
system
of
Brucella
[
2
]
-
[
4
]
.

BvrS
is
a
membrane
-
bound
homodimeric
protein
that
has
three
conserved
regions
frequently
found
in
members
of
the
histidine
protein
kinase
superfamily
:
an
amino
-
terminal
periplasmic
sensing
domain
with
transmembrane
segments
,
a
cytoplasmic
dimerisation
domain
with
a
specific
His
residue
,
and
the
carboxy
-
terminal
ATP
-
binding
kinase
domain
[
5
]
.

As
demonstrated
for
other
two
-
component
systems
,
multiple
genes
are
expected
to
be
under
the
control
of
BvrR
/
BvrS
[
1
]
.

B
.
abortus
mutants
in
this
system
were
more
susceptible
to
bactericidal
polycationic
substances
like
polymyxin
B
,
melittin
or
poly
-
L
-
lysine
,
and
displayed
a
more
hydrophobic
outer
membrane
surface
than
the
parental
strain
[
4
]
.

Later
studies
demonstrated
that
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
regulates
transcription
of
at
least
two
major
outer
membrane
proteins
,
Omp22
(
Omp3b
)
and
Omp25a
(
Omp3a
)
.

Changes
in
non
-
protein
envelope
molecules
such
as
lipid
A
underacylation
and
increased
LPS
acyl
-
chain
fluidity
have
been
also
found
in
these
mutants
[
3
]
.

Our
results
link
the
regulation
of
carbon
and
nitrogen
metabolism
to
the
expression
of
cell
envelope
components
and
suggest
the
existence
of
a
complex
regulatory
network
with
the
interplay
of
several
transcriptional
regulators
.

The
ORFeome
-
based
Brucella
whole
-
genome
DNA
microarray
used
in
this
study
has
been
previously
validated
for
the
analysis
of
gene
expression
under
any
experimental
conditions
[
7
]
.

A
change
in
gene
expression
was
considered
both
statistically
and
biologically
significant
if
the
p
-
value
was
less
than
0
.
01
.

Twenty
three
%
of
the
differentially
transcribed
genes
(
30
)
encoded
for
hypothetical
proteins
.

For
genes
of
annotated
function
,
59
appeared
to
be
up
regulated
and
38
down
regulated
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

Total
RNA
from
both
Brucella
strains
were
reverse
transcribed
into
cDNA
.

Interestingly
,
the
level
of
transcription
obtained
by
RT
-
PCR
of
the
flagellar
genes
fliM
(
BAB2
_
0124
)
and
motB
(
BAB2
_
1103
)
,
and
the
pckA
gene
(
BAB1
_
2091
)
were
the
highest
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

On
the
other
hand
,
exoR
(
BAB1
_
0891
)
,
omp25a
(
BAB1
_
0722
)
,
hpr
-
K
(
BAB1
_
2094
)
,
bvrS
(
BAB1
_
2093
)
and
the
lipoproteins
(
BAB1
_
2147
,
BAB1
_
0589
,
BAB1
_
0358
)
were
among
the
less
expressed
genes
(
Table
1
)
.

These
results
confirmed
a
good
correlation
between
microarray
and
RT
-
PCR
data
,
thus
validating
the
model
.

These
observations
led
to
the
hypothesis
that
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
is
involved
in
cell
envelope
changes
required
for
adaptation
to
the
intracellular
environment
.

Our
microarray
results
demonstrated
several
genes
directly
involved
in
cell
envelope
or
outer
membrane
biogenesis
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

These
data
confirm
that
BvrR
/
BvrS
regulates
bacterial
envelope
changes
that
could
modify
surface
properties
relevant
for
Brucella
virulence
[
6
]
.

One
of
the
remarkable
findings
observed
in
our
microarray
analysis
was
that
several
genes
related
with
metabolism
were
also
differentially
expressed
.

Interestingly
,
all
genes
related
with
carbohydrate
,
amino
or
fatty
acids
metabolism
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

These
included
the
first
enzyme
in
gluconeogenesis
(
pckA
,
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
,
BAB1
_
2091
)
,
four
genes
involved
in
TCA
cycle
and
pyruvate
metabolism
(
fumB
,
fumarate
hydratase
,
BAB1
_
0977
;
lpdA
,
dihydrolipoamide
dehydrogenase
,
BAB2
_
0712
;
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
,
BAB2
_
0032
;
acetyl
-
CoA
acetyltransferase
,
BAB2
_
0443
)
,
three
genes
involved
in
amino
or
fatty
acid
metabolism
(
aldehyde
dehydrogenases
,
BAB2
_
1130
,
BAB2
_
1114
;
hydroxymethylglutaryl
-
CoA
lyase
,
BAB1
_
0017
)
,
and
two
genes
involve
in
benzoate
degradation
(
pcaC
,
carboxymuconolactone
decarboxylase
,
BAB2
_
0597
;
pcaI
,
coenzyme
A
transferase
,
BAB2
_
0604
)
.

Ten
of
these
genes
,
including
malK
,
malG
,
malF
,
malE
and
an
iclR
regulator
,
were
down
-
regulated
suggesting
that
the
complete
operon
was
negatively
regulated
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

Although
it
has
been
showed
that
the
mutants
in
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
have
no
obvious
defects
with
regard
to
the
ability
to
grow
on
standard
media
[
4
]
,
our
microarray
results
suggests
that
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
controls
elements
directly
involved
in
adjusting
the
Brucella
metabolism
to
the
nutrient
shift
expected
to
occur
during
the
transit
to
the
intracellular
niche
.

As
show
in
Figure
3
,
growth
of
the
bvrR
mutant
was
significantly
reduced
in
minimal
media
.

The
nitrite
reductase
gene
(
nirK
,
BAB2
_
0943
)
was
down
regulated
and
the
nitric
oxide
and
nitrous
oxide
reductases
genes
(
nor
C
,
BAB2
_
0955
;
nosZ
,
BAB2
_
0928
)
were
up
regulated
.

Brucella
may
also
take
advantage
of
denitrification
to
cope
with
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
production
in
the
macrophage
during
the
innate
response
against
infection
.

Interestingly
,
our
experiments
to
study
the
intracellular
transcriptional
level
of
BvrR
/
BvrS
controlled
genes
(
see
below
)
showed
that
whereas
norC
was
induced
intracellularly
,
nirK
and
nosZ
were
less
expressed
.

Genes
encoding
proteins
related
to
the
PTS
,
including
a
HPr
Ser
-
kinase
,
an
EIIA
permease
of
the
mannose
family
and
a
HPr
homologue
precede
those
of
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
.

In
most
of
these
loci
,
upstream
of
the
regulatory
gene
the
pckA
is
divergently
expressed
(
Figure
2
)
.

In
alpha
-
proteobacteria
,
it
has
been
proposed
that
HPr
might
control
the
phosphorylation
state
of
the
transcription
regulator
[
12
]
-
[
14
]
.

In
this
regard
,
Letesson
and
col
.

Then
,
the
BvrR
could
control
transcription
of
the
pckA
gene
,
which
encodes
an
essential
control
enzyme
of
the
gluconeogenesis
and
Krebs
cycle
.

A
link
between
carbon
and
nitrogen
metabolism
,
PTS
and
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
have
been
proposed
for
some
bacteria
[
18
]
,
and
our
microarray
results
strongly
suggest
that
same
relationship
could
be
made
for
Brucella
.

BvrR
/
BvrS
and
the
expression
of
other
transcriptional
regulators

Notably
,
seven
transcriptional
regulators
genes
were
also
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
compared
to
parental
strain
:
BAB1
_
0237
,
BAB1
_
0891
(
exoR
)
,
BAB1
_
1397
,
BAB2
_
0118
(
vjbR
)
,
BAB2
_
0762
(
ompR
)
,
BAB2
_
1127
and
BAB2
_
1152
.

Three
of
these
,
namely
exoR
,
ompR
and
vjbR
are
down
regulated
and
have
been
previously
implicated
in
Brucella
virulence
.

Moreover
,
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
VjbR
controls
the
synthesis
of
exopolysaccharides
and
the
productions
of
several
OMPs
,
some
of
which
are
also
involved
in
virulence
[
22
]
.

Interestingly
,
our
results
also
showed
that
the
expression
of
vjbR
was
also
induced
intracellularly
(
see
below
)
.

All
these
data
suggest
that
VjbR
,
similarly
to
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
,
is
involved
in
the
control
of
outer
membrane
composition
and
virulence
.

In
addition
,
DeJong
and
col
[
20
]
have
demonstrated
that
among
the
promoters
which
expression
is
dependent
of
the
VjbR
regulator
,
is
the
ompR
gene
,
the
regulator
of
the
OmpR
/
EnvZ
two
component
system
.

E
.
coli
OmpR
/
EnvZ
system
controls
the
transcription
of
the
outer
membrane
porins
OmpF
and
OmpC
in
response
to
osmolarity
[
23
]
.

Moreover
,
a
systematically
transcriptome
analysis
of
all
two
component
regulatory
systems
in
E
.
coli
has
demonstrated
that
the
OmpR
/
EnvZ
system
also
controls
the
metabolism
of
amino
acids
,
flagellar
synthesis
and
nutrient
transport
[
24
]
.

The
two
-
regulatory
systems
ChvG
(
ExoS
)
/
ChvI
in
S
.
meliloti
and
A
.
tumefaciens
posses
a
high
level
of
identity
with
the
Brucella
BvrR
/
BvrS
[
25
]
,
[
26
]
.

Chaves
-
Olarte
et
al
have
reported
that
B
.
abortus
bvrS
mutant
complemented
with
the
ExoS
protein
recuperated
the
ability
to
invade
and
replicated
successfully
in
HeLa
and
macrophage
cells
[
27
]
,
suggesting
that
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
system
is
functionally
interchangeable
with
the
ExoS
/
ChvI
system
.

It
has
been
described
in
S
.
meliloti
that
exoR
gene
encodes
a
global
regulator
of
transcription
and
that
ExoR
interacts
genetically
with
both
ExoS
and
ChvI
and
inhibits
ExoS
/
ChvI
activity
[
29
]
,
[
30
]
.

Further
analysis
indicated
that
both
the
ExoR
protein
and
the
ExoS
/
ChvI
two
-
component
regulatory
system
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
both
polysaccharides
and
flagellum
biosynthesis
[
31
]
.

Other
authors
[
29
]
suggest
that
ExoR
is
an
inhibitor
of
two
-
component
signaling
that
may
be
conserved
in
a
large
number
of
alpha
-
proteobacteria
.

Based
on
all
these
findings
,
obvious
comparison
about
the
function
of
all
these
regulators
in
Brucella
could
be
made
.

Virulence
and
the
adaptation
to
intracellular
growth

Our
microarray
results
demonstrated
that
at
least
127
genes
were
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
.

Although
this
general
expression
changes
could
explain
the
complete
loss
of
virulence
of
these
mutants
,
it
was
remarkable
the
presence
among
them
of
ten
genes
,
in
addition
to
bvrS
,
whose
products
are
already
known
to
be
associated
with
Brucella
virulence
[
10
]
,
[
11
]
,
[
33
]
,
[
34
]
.

In
order
to
investigate
if
the
BvrR
/
BvrS
controlled
genes
were
expressed
intracellularly
,
bacterial
RNA
was
obtained
from
B
.
abortus
wild
type
recovered
from
infected
cells
as
described
in
Material
and
Methods
.

The
amount
of
bacterial
RNA
was
not
enough
to
perform
microarray
hybridizations
.

The
results
showed
significant
differences
in
the
expression
of
at
least
fifteen
genes
controlled
by
BvrR
/
BvrS
.

On
the
other
hand
,
two
genes
for
cell
envelope

one

)
and
three
denitrification
genes
(
norC
,
nirK
and
glutaminase
BAB2
_
0863
)
were
less
expressed
intracellularly
.

In
conclusion
,
all
these
results
and
previous
findings
support
the
proposal
that
BvrR
/
BvrS
controls
a
significantly
broad
set
of
phenotypes
and
define
an
important
and
coordinate
gateway
between
the
free

living
and
intracellular
states
of
Brucella
.

However
,
30
of
the
genes
differentially
expressed
in
the
bvrR
mutant
compared
with
the
parental
strain
have
a
yet
uncharacterized
function
.

IgG
Endopeptidase
SeMac
does
not
Inhibit
Opsonophagocytosis
of
Streptococcus
equi
Subspecies
equi
by
Horse
Polymorphonuclear
Leukocytes

The
secreted
Mac
protein
made
by
group
A
Streptococcus
(
GAS
)
inhibits
opsonophagocytosis
of
GAS
by
human
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
PMNs
)
.

This
protein
also
has
the
endopeptidase
activity
against
human
immunoglobulin
G
(
IgG
)
,
and
the
Cys94
,
His262
and
Asp284
are
critical
for
the
enzymatic
activity
.

The
horse
pathogen
Streptococcus
equi
subspecies
equi
produces
a
homologue
of
Mac
(
SeMac
)
.

The
gene
was
cloned
and
recombinant
SeMac
was
overexpressed
in
Escherichia
coli
and
purified
to
homogeneity
.

Mice

S

and
horses

.
equi
seroconverted
to
SeMac
,
indicating
that
SeMac
is
produced
in

during
infection
.

However
,
the
protein
just
cleaves
a
small
fraction
,
which
may
be
IgG1
only
,
of
horse
IgG
.

Replacement
of
Cys102
with
Ser
or
His272
with
Ala
abolishes
the
enzymatic
activity
of
SeMac
,
and
the
Asp294Ala
mutation
greatly
decreases
the
enzymatic
activity
.

There
is
massive
infiltration
of
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
PMNs
)
to
the
infection
site
.

However
,
S
.
equi
effectively
evades
the
horse
innate
immunity
by
being
resistant
to
phagocytosis
by
PMNs
.

To
survive
in
hosts
,
bacterial
pathogens
have
evolved
multiple
mechanisms
to
evade
host
defense
.

We
found
that
GAS
produces
a
secreted
Mac
protein
(
also
known
as
IdeE
)
,
which
inhibits
opsonophagocytosis
of
GAS
by
human
PMNs
[

]
.

The
type
-
1
Mac
,
such
as
M1
Mac
produced
by
serotype
M1
GAS
strains
,
has
high
enzymatic
activity
and
low
affinity
to
Fc

on
the
surface
of
PMNs
,
while
the
type
-
2
Mac
can
bind
to
the
Fc
receptor
and
has
lower
enzymatic
activity

.

In

,
SeMac

All

.

DNA

found
that
the

in

No

in
all
the
samples
(

,
suggesting
that
SeMac
is
not
produced
in

To

whether
SeMac
is
produced

,
the

was

by

Endopeptidase
Activity
of
SeMac
against
Horse
IgG1
and
Human
IgG

GAS
Mac
can
cleave
the
heavy
chain
of
human
IgG
at
the
lower
hinge
region
between
Fab
and
Fc
fragments
.

SeMac
possesses
putative
catalytic
residues
of
Cys102
,
His272
,
and
Asp294
(
Fig
.
1
)
.

Purified
recombinant
SeMac
and
GAS
Mac
were
then
tested
for
activity
to
cleave
horse
IgG
.

To
test
this
possibility
,
available
horse
IgG1
and
a
mixture
of
IgG1
and
IgG4
were
treated
with
SeMac
or
GAS
Mac
.

SeMac
or
GAS
Mac
cleaved
a
small
portion
of
the
IgG1
/
IgG4
mixture
,
but
not
IgG4
.

Therefore
,
the
Mac
proteins
can
cleave
IgG1
but
not
IgG4
.

Due
to
the
unavailability
of
other
purified
subgroup
IgG
,
it
is
not
known
whether
SeMac
cleaves
the
other
IgG
subgroups
.

A
whole
blood
based
phagocytosis
assay
[
13
,
14
]
was
used
to
test
whether
SeMac
inhibits
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

Percentage
of
PMNs
with
phagocytosed
S
.
equi
was
determined
by
flow
cytometry
.

As
expected
,
percentage
of
PMNs
with
phagocytosed
S
.
equi
with
the
serum
treatment
was
significantly
higher
than
that
for
S
.
equi
without
serum
treatment
.

But
the
inclusion
of
SeMac
in
the
assay
did
not
affect
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
(
Fig
.
5A
)
,
suggesting
that
SeMac
does
not
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

To
test
this
idea
,
the
phagocytosis
assay
was
repeated
using
GAS
and
human
blood
.

These
results
suggest
that
IgG
endopeptidase
activity
of
SeMac
is
critical
for
inhibition
of
phagocytosis
.

In
this
study
we
describe
that
SeMac
is
a
cysteine
endopeptidase
with
limited
activity
against
horse
IgG
and
is
unable
to
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
in
a
whole
blood
assay
.

SeMac
efficiently
cleaves
the
heavy
chain
of
human
IgG
.

Thus
,
like
GAS
M1
Mac
[
7
,
8
]
,
SeMac
is
a
cysteine
endopeptidase
.

The
peptide
fragment
,
PELLGG
,
in
the
lower
hinge
region
is
proposed
to
bind
to
the
active
site
of
Mac
[
9
]
,
and
the
cleavage
occurs
between
the
two
Gly
residues
(
Table
1
)
.

These
horse
IgG
antibodies
that
cannot
be
cleaved
by
SeMac
thus
still
can
mediate
the
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
.

SeMac
and
GAS
M1
Mac
show
similar
enzymatic
specificity
(
Fig
.
4
and
Table
1
)
,
confirming
the
previous
finding
[
18
]
.

SeMac
can
cleave
human
IgG
and
inhibit
the
opsonophagocytosis
of
GAS
by
human
PMNs
,
but
it
has
limited
enzymatic
activity
against
horse
IgG
and
is
unable
to
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
.

SeMac
is
not
produced
in
vitro
,
whereas
GAS
Mac
is
[
16
]
.

The
hyaluronic
capsule
of
S
.
equi
is
highly
produced
in
vitro
.

This
suggestion
is
supported
by
only
29
%
DNA
sequence
identity
between
S
.
equi
and
M1
GAS
in
the
upstream
region
of
the
semac
and
mac
genes
.

The
fact
that
SeMac
does
not
inhibit
opsonophagocytosis
of
S
.
equi
by
horse
PMNs
indicates
that
SeMac
is
not
involved
in
the
evasion
of
the
acquired
horse
immunity
against
S

equi
.

However
,

about

Substitution

of

Our
results
suggest
that
protonation
of
the
PmrB
periplasmic
histidine
and
/
or
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
activate
the
PmrA
protein
,
and
that
mild
acid
promotes
cellular
changes
resulting
in
polymyxin
B
resistance
.

Free
-
living
organisms
often
encounter
wide
variations
in
the
pH
of
their
surroundings
.

Thus
,
pH
may
act
as
a
signal
that
triggers
cellular
responses
designed
to
cope
with
a
new
environment
.

Moreover
,
Salmonella
has
been
recovered
from
soil
and
water
(
Winfield
and
Groisman
,
2003
)
where
the
pH
can
be
significantly
low
.

While
growth
in
acidic
conditions
has
been
shown
to
promote
changes
in
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
several
bacterial
species
(
Tucker
et

,
2002
;
McGowan
et

,
2003
;
Weinrick
et

,

Leaphart

)
,
less
is
known
about
the
identity
of
the
molecule
(
s
)
that
sense
extracytoplasmic
fluctuations
in
pH
and
the
mechanisms
by
which
such
sensors
promote
changes
in
gene
expression
.

While
other
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
have
been
identified
(
Marchal
et
al
.
,
2004
;
Tamayo
et
al
.
,
2005
)
,
their
biochemical
activities
and
the
role
(
s
)
that
they
play
in
Salmonella
'
s
life
remain
unknown
.

PmrD
binds
to
the
phosphorylated
form
of
PmrA
protecting
it
from
dephosphorylation
by
PmrB
(
Kato
and
Groisman
,
2004
)
.

All
three
genes
were
expressed
when
cells
were
grown
in
media
buffered
at
pH
5
.
8
but
not
at
pH
7
.
7
(
Fig
.
2A
-
C
)
,
in
agreement
with
previous
results
(
Soncini
and
Groisman
,
1996
)
.

A
similar
induction
of
pbgP
transcription
was
found
when
MES
was
used
as
the
buffering
agent
in
the
media
at
pH
5
.
8
instead
of
Bis
-
Tris
(
data
not
shown
)
,
indicating
that
the
mild
acid
effect
on
gene
expression
was
not
due
to
a
particular
buffering
system
.

To
rule
out
this
possibility
,
we
treated
the
culture
medium
with
Chelex
100
resin
,
an
agent
known
to
chelate
polyvalent
metal
ions
that
does
not
affect
Salmonella
growth
.

We
determined
that
Chelex
100
was
effective
at
chelating
iron
because
expression
of
the
pmrA
-
independent
iron
-
repressed
iroA
gene
(
Hall
and
Foster
,
1996
)
was
induced
to
higher
levels
in
cultures
treated
with
Chelex
100
(
Fig
.
2D
)
.

We
determined
that
the
regulatory
protein
PmrA
is
required
for
the
transcriptional
activation
in
response
to
mild
acid
pH
because
there
was
no
induction
of
the
three
investigated
genes
in
a
pmrA
mutant
(
Fig
.
2A
-
C
)
.

Thus
,
we
determined
the
beta
-
galactosidase
activity
of
isogenic
pmrB
strains
harbouring
a
chromosomal
pbgP
-
lac
transcriptional
fusion
:
expression
was
approximately
sixfold
lower
in
a
pmrB
mutant
than
in
the
pmrB
+
strain
following
growth
at
pH
5
.
8
(
Fig
.
3
)
,
indicating
that
a
functional
pmrB
gene
is
necessary
for
a
normal
response
to
mild
acid
pH
.

This
suggested
that
PmrA
could
become
phosphorylated
from
another
phosphodonor
(
s
)
when
PmrB
is
not
present
.

In
contrast
,
a
strain
lacking
the
ability
to
synthesize
acetyl
phosphate
but
with
a
functional
pmrB
gene
exhibited
wild
-
type
pbgP
expression
levels
(
Fig
.
3
)
,
implying
that
under
normal
conditions
(
i
.
e
.
when
a
functional
pmrB
gene
is
present
)
acetyl
phosphate
does
not
contribute
to
PmrA
phosphorylation
.

The
PhoP
-
activated
PmrD
protein
favours
the
phosphorylated
state
of
the
PmrA
protein
(
Fig
.
1
)
(
Kato
and
Groisman
,
2004
)
.

Thus
,
we
tested
the
possibility
of
PmrD
participating
in
the
PmrA
-
dependent
response
to
acidic
conditions
,
and
thus
contributing
to
the
pbgP
transcription
remaining
in
a
pmrB
mutant
.

Expression
of
the
pbgP
gene
was
abolished
in
a
pmrB
pmrD
double
mutant
(
Fig
.
3
)
indicating
that
both
genes
are
necessary
to
activate
PmrA
under
acidic
conditions
.

These
results
imply
that
the
pmrD
gene
was
being
expressed
even
though
the
media
contained
10
mM
MgCl2
,
a
concentration
known
to
repress
transcription
of
PhoP
-
activated
genes
(
Soncini
et
al
.
,
1996
)
.

Growth
at
pH
5
.
8
resulted
in
pmrD
transcript
levels
that
were
approximately3
.
5
-
fold
higher
than
in
organisms
grown
at
pH
7
.
7
(
Fig
.
4A
)
.

In
agreement
with
the
gene
transcription
data
,
Western
blot
analysis
of
crude
extracts
using
anti
-
PmrD
antibodies
showed
that
the
PmrD
protein
was
produced
in
cells
grown
in
N
-
minimal
medium
pH
5
.
8
and
10
mM
MgCl2
but
not
in
cells
grown
in
the
same
medium
buffered
at
pH
7
.
7
(
Fig
.
4B
)
.

To
examine
this
hypothesis
,
we
tested
a
Salmonella
strain
with
a
chromosomal
pbgP
-
lac
fusion
,
deleted
for
the
chromosomal
copy
of
the
pmrB
gene
and
harbouring
a
plasmid
expressing
a
PmrB
protein
lacking
its
periplasmic
domain
for
its
ability
to
promote
pbgP
expression
in
response
to
different
signals
.

There
was
no
pbgP
expression
in
cells
grown
at
pH
5
.
8
(
Fig
.
5B
)
or
in
the
presence
of
Fe3
+
(
Fig
.
5D
)
,
which
is
in
contrast
to
the
normal
activation
in
response
to
low
Mg2
+
(
Fig
.
5C
)
.

Together
,
these
results
argue
in
favour
of
the
notion
that
PmrB
senses
extracellular
pH
besides
its
previously
described
ligands
Fe3
+
and
Al3
+
(
Wosten
et
al
.
,
2000
)
.

Interestingly
,
one
of
these
conserved
residues
was
a
histidine
at
position
35
.

We
considered
the
possibility
that
a
second
histidine
at
position
57
could
be
involved
in
sensing
acid
despite
the
fact
that
this
residue
was
only
partially
conserved
across
species
(
Fig
.
6A
)
.

Although
the
pKa
of
free
glutamic
acid
is
approximately4
,
which
is
well
below
the
range
of
pH
at
which
PmrA
-
activated
genes
are
induced
,
the
folding
of
a
protein
can
dramatically
change
the
pKa
of
its
residues
.

For
instance
,
the
pKa
of
one
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
of
the
regulatory
protein
TraM
is
approximately7
.
7
(
Lu
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

Therefore
,
we
hypothesized
that
one
or
more
of
the
glutamates
might
be
required
for
pH
sensing
.

Strains
expressing
the
mutant
PmrB
proteins
could
express
pbgP
normally
in
response
to
the
low
Mg2
+
signal
(
Fig
.
6C
)
(
Wosten
et
al
.
,
2000
)
,
indicating
that
mutations
in
residues
of
the
periplasmic
domain
of
PmrB
do
not
impair
the
enzymatic
activity
of
the
cytoplasmic
domain
of
the
PmrB
protein
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
periplasmic
glutamates
are
required
for
responding
to
mild
acid
pH
.

What
role
could
the
mild
acid
pH
-
dependent
activation
of
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
play
in
Salmonella
'
s
lifestyle
?

In
fact
,
the
survival
of
wild
-
type
cells
to
a
challenge
with
polymyxin
B
was
100
000
-
fold
higher
when
they
were
grown
at
pH
5
.
8
than
when
grown
at
pH
7

(

.

Discussion

We
have
established
that
the
sensor
kinase
PmrB
is
the
primary
sensor
that
activates
the
PmrA
protein
when
Salmonella
experiences
mild
acid
pH
,
resulting
in
transcription
of
PmrA
-
activated
genes
(
Fig
.

)
.

The
requirement
of
periplasmic
PmrB
residues
in
the
mild
acid
pH
activation
of
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
suggests
that
this
signalling
pathway
responds
to
changes
in
extracytoplasmic
pH
.

For
example
,
the
eukaryotic
G
-
protein
coupled
receptor
OGR1
is
inactive
at
pH
7
.
8
and
fully
active
at
pH
6
.
8
suggesting
that
the
pH
sensing
mechanism
involves
protonation
of
several
extracytoplasmic
histidines
(
Ludwig
et
al
.
,
2003
)
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
pKa
of
free
histidine
of
approximately6
.

Therefore
,
regulation
of
PmrB
activity
may
involve
protonation
of
one
or
more
of
these
amino
acids
.

Even
though
protonation
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
may
seem
unlikely
given
the
fact
that
the
pKa
of
free
glutamic
acid
is
approximately4
,
protein
folding
can
change
the
pKa
of
its
residues
(
Tanford
and
Roxby
,
1972
)
.

Indeed
,
the
pKa
of
one
of
the
glutamic
acid
residues
of
the
regulatory
protein
TraM
is
approximately7
.
7
in
the
folded
protein
(
Lu
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

The
CadC
protein
of
E
.
coli
,
for
example
,
is
activated
by
exogenous
lysine
besides
acid
pH
(
Dell
et
al
.
,
1994
)
.

Furthermore
,
the
ability
to
sense
two
different
compounds
has
also
recently
been
shown
to
be
genetically
distinguishable
in
the
bacterial
chemoreceptor
Tcp
(
Iwama
et
al
.
,
2006
)
.

What
role
could
the
pH
-
dependent
activation
of
PmrA
-
regulated
genes
play
in
Salmonella
'
s
lifestyle
?

Indeed
,
when
grown
at
pH
5
.
8
wild
-
type
Salmonella
were
100
000
-
fold
more
resistant
to
polymyxin
B
than
when
grown
at
pH
7
.
7
(
Fig
.

)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
although
mild
acid
(
pH
6
.
0
)
per
se
,
i
.
e
.
even
in
the
presence
of
high
Mg2
+
,
promotes
LPS
modifications
(
Gibbons
et
al
.
,
2005
)
,
the
low
pH
signal
may
also
act
synergistically
with
the
low
Mg2
+
signal
in
vivo
because
Mg2
+
deprivation
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
provide
all
the
LPS
modifications
seen
in
Salmonella
when
present
inside
macrophages
(
Gibbons
et
al
.
,
2005
)
.

A
Salmonella
enterica
serovar
Typhimurium
mlc
mutant
showed
reduced
levels
of
invasion
and
cytotoxicity
compared
to
the
wild
-
type
,
and
exhibited
reduced
expression
levels
of
hilD
,
hilA
and
invF
,
which
are
regulatory
genes
in
the
Salmonella
pathogenicity
island
1
(
SPI1
)
.

However
,
the
effects
of
Mlc
on
hilD
expression
and
bacterial
invasiveness
were
not
seen
in
the
hilE
mutant
,
and
hilE
expression
was
increased
in
the
mlc
mutant
,
which
suggests
that
Mlc
exerts
positive
effects
on
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
by
reducing
the
expression
of
HilE
,
which
is
known
to
down
-
regulate
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
through
direct
interaction
with
HilD
.

We
found
that
the
two
known
promoters
of
hilE
were
not
modulated
by
Mlc
,
and
we
identified
a
third
promoter
,
designated
P3
,
which
was
repressed
by
Mlc
.

The
gel
mobility
shift
assay
and
footprinting
analysis
revealed
that
Mlc
repressed
hilE
in
a
direct
manner
by
binding
to
two
distinct
sites
in
the
hilE
P3
promoter
region
.

Based
on
these
results
,
we
propose
that
Mlc
functions
to
sense
the
availability
of
sugars
and
is
linked
to
virulence
gene
regulation
by
its
ability
to
control
hilE
expression
in
Salmonella
.

Salmonella
enterica
serovar
Typhimurium
is
a
facultative
intracellular
pathogen
that
initiates
disease
,
which
is
normally
limited
to
gastroenteritis
in
humans
.

However
,
this
bacterium
causes
systemic
disease
in
mice
and
has
been
used
as
an
animal
model
of
typhoid
fever
.

Since
Salmonella
is
acquired
usually
by
oral
ingestion
of
contaminated
materials
,
a
key
step
in
the
infection
process
is
passage
across
the
intestinal
epithelium
by
invasion
of
M
cells
in
Peyer
'
s
patches
(
1
)
.

SPI1
contains
at
least
37
genes
,
which
encode
various
components
of
the
type
III
secretion
systems
(
T3SSs
)
,
its
regulators
and
its
secreted
effectors
(
3
)
.

The
effector
proteins
mediate
actin
cytoskeleton
rearrangement
,
in
the
form
of
large
membrane
ruffles
,
which
engulf
the
bacteria
into
the
host
cell
(
4
,
5
)
.

Although
many
factors
and
a
complex
mechanism
related
to
environmental
stimuli
are
involved
in
the
modulation
of
SPI1
genes
,
they
are
thought
to
converge
on
the
activation
of
several
transcriptional
regulators
encoded
within
SPI1
,
such
as
HilA
,
HilC
,
HilD
and
InvF
(
7
-
9
)
.

The
expression
of
invF
leads
to
the
induction
of
several
effector
genes
encoded
both
within
SPI1
(
sic
/
sip
operon
)
and
outside
SPI1
(
sigD
/
sopB
and
sopE
)
,
with
SicA
as
a
co
-
factor
(
11
)
.

HilC
and
HilD
,
which
are
members
of
the
AraC
/
XylS
family
,
have
been
postulated
to
act
as
a
derepressor
of
hilA
expression
by
counteracting
the
action
of
negative
regulatory
elements
at
the
hilA
promoter
(
12
,
13
)
.

Similar
to
HilC
and
HilD
,
RtsA
activates
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
by
binding
upstream
of
the
master
regulatory
gene
,
hilA
,
to
induce
its
expression
(
9
,
17
)
.

Using
two
-
hybrid
analysis
,
it
has
been
shown
that
HilE
interacts
with
HilD
,
which
suggests
that
HilE
represses
hilA
expression
by
inhibiting
the
activity
of
HilD
through
a
protein
-
protein
interaction
(
19
,
20
)
.

The
phosphoenolpyruvate
:
sugar
phosphotransferase
system
(
PTS
)
is
the
major
sugar
transport
system
in
many
Gram
-
positive
and
Gram
-
negative
bacterial
species
.

Therefore
,
it
seemed
possible
that
Mlc
also
affects
the
virulence
of
Salmonella
.

In
the
present
study
,
a
Salmonella
Typhimurium
mlc
mutant
was
constructed
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
Mlc
to
the
virulence
phenotype
.

We
examined
the
ability
of
an
mlc
mutant
,
SR1304
,
to
invade
cultured
HEp
-
2
and
HeLa
epithelial
cells
.

When
the
Salmonella
bacteria
were
grown
in
static
cultures
to
the
exponential
phase
(
SPI1
-
inducing
condition
)
,
the
invasiveness
of
SR1304
for
both
epithelial
cell
lines
was
reduced
by
about
3
-
fold
,
compared
to
that
of
SL1344
(
Figure
1A
and
B
)
.

S
.

Typhimurium
induces
the
apoptosis
of
infected
macrophages
.

This
process
is
rapid
,
specific
and
depends
on
the
T3SS
encoded
within
SPI1
(
33
,
34
)
.

Figure
1C
shows
that
SL1344
killed
42
%
of
the
macrophages
,
whereas
SR1304
killed
only
16
%
of
the
macrophages
4h
after
infection
,
which
demonstrates
that
the
mlc
gene
plays
an
important
role
in
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
cytotoxicity
.

When
the
number
of
intracellular
bacteria
were
measured
at
2
and
18h
post
-
infection
,
the
degree
of
replication
was
similar
for
SL1344
and
SR1304
(
Figure
1D
)
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
main
target
of
Mlc
action
in
Salmonella
virulence
is
SPI1
,
which
is
known
to
encode
various
genes
that
are
required
for
Salmonella
invasion
of
host
cells
.

The
expression
levels
of
hilA
,
invF
and
hilD
,
but
not
of
hilC
,
are
decreased
in
the
mlc
mutant

To
identify
the
target
gene
in
SPI1
that
is
regulated
by
Mlc
,
the
expression
patterns
of
the
SPI1
-
regulatory
genes
,
which
include
hilA
,
invF
,
hilC
and
hilD
,
were
examined
by
primer
extension
analysis
of
total
RNA
from
SL1344
and
SR1304
grown
statically
to
the
exponential
phase
.

The
transcriptional
start
sites
of
these
genes
have
been
reported
previously
(
12
,
16
,
35
,
36
)
.

SR1304
exhibited
a
>
10
-
fold
reduction
in
hilA
and
HilA

(

expression
,
and
about
a
3

reduction
in
hilD
and
HilC
/
D

invF
(
invFD
)
expression
,
compared
to
SL1344
.

Mlc
modulates
the
expression
of
SPI1
genes
by
repressing

Subsequently
,
we
studied
whether
hilE
expression
was
affected
by
Mlc
.

Baxter
et
al
.

When
these
cells
were
grown
in

to

,

expressed

5

3
Miller
units
of
beta

;
the
level
of
hilE
expression
in
the
mlc
mutant
was
almost
1
.
8
-
fold
higher
than
that
in
the
wild
-
type
strain
.

The
hilE
mRNA
level
measured
by
real

time
PCR
also
revealed
that
hilE
expression
was
increased
in
SR1304
by
about
2
-
fold
(
Figure
3A
)
.

The
role
of
HilE
in
the
regulation
of
SPI1
gene
expression
by
Mlc
was
further
studied
by
comparing
the
invasive
abilities
of
the
hilE
and
hilE
/
mlc
mutant
strains
of
Salmonella
.

Invasiveness
for
HEp
-
2
cells
was
reduced
to
39
.
1
%
of
the
wild
-
type
level
by
mlc
mutation
,
whereas
it
was
increased
by
1
.
57
-
fold
by
hilE
mutation
(
Figure
3B
)
.

The
requirement
of
hilE
for
Mlc
function
was
reflected
in
the
levels
of
hilD
transcription
.

While
hilD
expression
was
reduced
in
the
mlc
mutant
,
it
was
slightly
higher
than
the
wild
-
type
level
in
both
the
hilE
and
hilE
/
mlc
mutant
strains
(
Figure
3C
)
.

Additionally
,
the
over
-
expression
of
HilD
from
the
plasmid
pJB3
containing
hilD
gene
under
the
control
of
a
lac
promoter
caused
the
induction
of
hilA
by
approximately2
-
fold
and
invF
by
approximately6
-
fold
irrespective
of
hilE
or
mlc
mutation
when
real

PCR
was
used
to
compare
the
expression
levels
(
data
not
shown
)
.

The
hilE
P3
promoter
is
repressed
by
Mlc

Baxter
and
Jones
(
18
)
have
identified
two
independent
hilE
promoters
,
P1
and
P2
.

The
transcriptional
start
site
of
one
transcript
,
designated
P1
,
agreed
with
the
previous
report
,
although
the
promoter
activity
was
very
low
under
the
conditions
used
in
our
experiment
(
Figure
4A
)
.

However
,
the
activities
of
the
two
promoters
were
not
changed
by
mlc
mutation
.

Mlc
directly
represses
hilE
by
binding
to
the
P3
promoter

The
addition
of
cold
probe
released
the
labeled
probe
from
the
retarded
complex
(
Figure
5A
,
right
panel
)
,
which
indicates
specific
binding
of
Mlc
to
the
hilE
P3
promoter
DNA
.

The
precise
locations
of
the
Mlc
-
binding
sites
were
determined
by
DNase
I
footprinting
with
His
-
tagged
Mlc
.

Two
Mlc
-
binding
sites
,
one
at
position
-
10
to
+
12
(
Mlc
1
)
and
the
other
at
position
-
86
to
-
108
(
Mlc
2
)
with
respect
to
the
transcriptional
start
site
of
hilE
P3
,
were
identified
(
Figure
5B
)
.

Inspection
of
the
DNA
sequences
at
these
sites
showed
high
-
level
homology
with
the
known
consensus
Mlc
-
binding
sequence
,
which
has
the
conserved
TT
-
9bp
-
AA
motif
and
an
AT
-
rich
region
at
positions
+
/
-
7
to
+
/
-
11
,
showing
imperfect
dyad
symmetry
(
38
)
(
Figure
5C
)
.

These
results
clearly
demonstrate
that
Mlc
can
regulate
directly
the
hilE
P3
promoter
by
binding
to
the
promoter
.

Sugars
that
induce
the
Mlc
regulon
repress

expression
by
activating
hilE

Sequestration
of
Mlc
by
the
unphosphorylated
form
of
glucose
permease
,
enzyme
IICBGlc
,
is
known
to
displace
Mlc
from
its
DNA
-
binding
sites
,
thereby
allowing
transcription
of
its
target
genes
(
25
-
27
)
.

SL1344
and
SR1304
carrying
either
pMAB69
(
hilE
-
lacZY
)
or
pJB5
(
hilD
-
lacZY
)
were
cultivated
in
TB
that
was
buffered
to
pH
7
.
0
with
0
.
1M
MOPS
,
to
minimize
pH
effects
arising
from
growth
in
the
presence
of
the
various
carbon
sources
.

Interestingly
,
arabinose
also
activated
hilE
,
albeit
to
a
lesser
degree
than
either
glucose
or
mannose
.

In
the
absence
of
sugars
,
the
mlc
mutation
increased
hilE
expression
1
.
5
-
fold
,
with
a
concomitant
reduction
in
hilD
expression
.

The
genetic
evidence
to
date
is
consistent
with
a
regulatory
cascade
of
transcriptional
activation
,
in
which
HilD
,
HilA
and
InvF
act
sequentially
to
activate
SPI1
expression
.

In
brief
,
HilD
binds
directly
to
sites
upstream
of
hilA
and
invFD
and
acts
as
an
activator
(
14
,
16
,
36
)
.

The
2
-
3
-
fold
decrease
in
hilD
expression
caused
by
the
mlc
mutation
is
sufficient
to
account
for
the
nearly
10
-
fold
decrease
in
hilA
and
invFA
transcription
,
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
feed
-
forward
regulatory
loop
,
in
that
moderate
effects
on
HilD
production
are
amplified
(
9
)
.

This
may
be
partly
due
to
the
expression
of
hilC
,
a
de
-
repressor
of
hilA
,
which
was
not
reduced
in
the
mlc
mutant
(
Figure
2A
)
.

The
two
Mlc
-
binding
sites
in
hilE
P3
identified
by
the
gel
mobility
shift
assay
and
DNase
I
footprinting
analysis
show
high
-
level
homology
with
the
known
consensus
Mlc
-
binding
sequences
;
additionally
,
the
two
Mlc
-
binding
sites
are
separated
by
98nt
,
as
is
the
case
for
other
promoters
that
have
two
Mlc
-
binding
sites
(
41
)
.

The
transcriptional
start
site
of
the
hilE
P3
promoter
lies
335nt
upstream
of
the
ATG
start
codon
of
hilE
(
Figures
4B
and
5C
)
.

It
is
unusual
that
the
5
'
-
untranslated
region
(
UTR
)
of
mRNA
is
more
than
300nt
in
bacteria
(
42
)
.

However
,
this
length
of
5
'
-
UTR
has
been
observed
in
other
SPI1
regulators
.

The
addition
of
excess
glucose
to
the
culture
medium
results
in
the
reduction
of
cell
association
by
S
.

Typhimurium
(
44
)
.

We
observed
a
2
-
fold
activation
of
hilE
and
concomitant
repression
of
hilD
in
the
presence
of
glucose
or
mannose
,
which
are
known
inducers
of
the
Mlc
regulon
,
when
TB
was
used
(
Figure
6
)
.

In
addition
,
hilE
expression
was
also
increased
in
the
presence
of
arabinose
,
which
suggests
an
additional
regulatory
mechanism
mediated
by
arabinose
.

Interestingly
,
carbohydrate
regulation
of
hilE
and
hilD
expression
in
the
mlc
mutant
created
a
different
story
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
PhoR
-
PhoB
leads
to
increased
hilE
P2
expression
and
subsequent
repression
of
hilA
and
invasion
genes
(
7
,
18
)
.

The
PhoR
sensor
kinase
phosphorylates
PhoB
when
extracellular
Pi
levels
are
low
,
and
the
phosphorylated
PhoB
then
binds
and
activates
the
promoters
in
the
Pho
regulon
.

However
,
even
in
the
absence
of
PhoR
,
many
carbon
sources
are
known
to
activate
the
Pho
regulon
via
CreC
,
which
is
a
PhoR
homolog
(

)
.

Thus
,
carbon
metabolism
sensed
by
PhoB
/
R
may
also
affect
hilE
expression
(

)
,
and
this
may
be
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
elevated
hilE
expression
in
the
presence
of
carbohydrates
in
the
mlc
mutant

Methodology
/
Principal
Findings
89K
is
a
newly
predicted
pathogenicity
island
(
PAI
)
which
is
specific
to
Chinese
epidemic
strains
isolated
from
these
two
SS2
outbreaks
.

Functional
complementation
of
salKR
into
the
isogenic
mutant
DeltasalKR
restored
its
soaring
pathogenicity
.

Colonization
experiments
showed
that
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
could
not
colonize
any
susceptible
tissue
of
piglets
when
administered
alone
.

Bactericidal
assays
demonstrated
that
resistance
of
the
mutant
to
polymorphonuclear
leukocyte
(
PMN
)
-
mediated
killing
was
greatly
decreased
.

Expression
microarray
analysis
exhibited
a
transcription

alteration
of
26
various
genes
down

regulated
in
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
.

Conclusions
/
Significance
These
findings
suggest
that
SalK
/
SalR
is
requisite
for
the
full
virulence
of
ethnic
Chinese
isolates
of
highly
pathogenic
SS2
,
thus
providing
experimental
evidence
for
the
validity
of
this
bioinformatically
predicted
PAI
.

A
key
feature
of
these
two
Chinese
outbreaks
is
the
prevalence
of
a
toxic
shock
-
like
syndrome
manifesting
itself
as
acute
high
fever
,
multiple
organ
failures
,
short
course
of
disease
and
high
lethality
[

]
.

Despite
the
growing
significance
of
such
infections
,
little
is
known
about
the
factors
that
govern
the
physiological
responses
of
this
emerging
organism
,
especially
the
genetic
repertoire
that
the
streptococcus
employs
to
cause
the
toxic
shock
-
like
syndrome
.

However
,
this
bioinformatically
predicted
candidate
PAI
needs
experimental
validation
and
its
linkage
to
SS2
-
related
high
pathogenicity
remains
unknown
.

A
wide
range
of
molecular
machineries
such
as
quorum
sensing
,
TCSTS
,
and
ABC
transporters
,
are
often
involved
in
a
putative
PAI
,
whereby
the
PAI
responds
to
environmental
signals
and
fulfills
its
critical
functions
contributing
to
the
virulence
in
pathogens
[

]
-
[

]
.

Further
bioinformatics
analysis
of
the
89K
island
revealed
a
distinct
two
-
component
signal
transduction
system
(
TCSTS
)
encoded
therein
appears
to
be
orthologous
to
the
SalK
/
SalR
system
of
S
.
salivarius
,
a
salivaricin
regulated
TCSTS
[

]
.

Up
until
now
,
only
one
orphan
response
regulator
,
RevS
,
has
been
found
to
be
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
SS2
[

.

Results

On
the
negative
strand
of
89K
,
peptides
encoded
by
05SSU0944
and
05SSU0943
exhibit
27
%
and
41
%
amino
acid
sequence
identity
with
the
SalK
and
the
SalR
proteins
of
Streptococcus
salivarius
,
respectively
,
forming
a
TCSTS
belonging
to
the
Nar
/
LuxR
family
.

Notably
,
the
average
GC
content
of
salKR
,

.
9
%
,
is
much
less
than
that
of
both
89K
and
the
whole
genome
of
05ZYH33
(

.
8
%
and
41
.
1
%
,
respectively
)
(

.

salK
encodes
a
396
aa
long
protein
,
with
five
N
-
terminal
transmembrane
domains
and
a
transmitter
domain
signature
motif
in
the
C
-
terminal
-
typical
of
sensor

protein
kinases
of
TCSTSs
[

]
.

As
some
TCSTS
gene
pairs
are
adjacent
to
the
genes
that
they
control
,
the
genetic
structure
of
the
salKR
locus
and
its
flanking
genes
was
defined
(
Fig
.
2A
)
.

The
salK
coding
region
overlaps
that
of
salR
by
20
base
pairs
(
bp
)
,
and
no
putative
promoter
or
transcriptional
terminator
could
be
identified
within
either
gene
.

A
putative
promoter
located
approximately
50
bp
upstream
from
the
TTG
initiation
codon
of
salK
,
was
predicted
using
the
online
server
of
Neutral
Network
Promoter
Prediction
.

Further
sequence
analysis
revealed
a
palindrome
of
55
bp
with
the
potential
to
form
a
stem
-
loop
structure
situated
in
the
intergenic
region
between
salR
and
05SSU0942
,
which
may
function
as
a
transcriptional
terminator
.

05SSU0945
,
situated
upstream
(
729
bp
long
intergenic
region
)
of
the
salKR
locus
,
encodes
a
94
aa
polypeptide
for
which
there
were
no
significant
database
matches
.

Construction
of
DeltasalKR

Positive
transformants
were
first
screened
on
THB
agar
plates
under
the
selective
pressure
of
spectinomycin
.

To
check
this
suspected
mutant
,
Southern
hybridization
analyses
were
employed
using
probes
of
SpcR
gene
,
an
internal
fragment
of
salKR
,
and
pUC18
,
respectively
.

In
a
single
cross
-
over
mutant
which
was
set
as
the
reference
,
both
the
SpcR
and
pUC18
probe
hybridized
with
a

(

,
and
the
salKR
probe
hybridized
with
a
4
.
0
kb
fragment
(
Fig
.
3C
,
lane

)
,
indicating
that
this
strain
had
pUC

:
salKR
integrated
into
its
chromosome
by
a
single
cross
-
over
event
at
the
3
'
-
flanking
region
of
the
salKR
genes
(
Fig

,

)
.

Additionally
,
the
allelic
replacement
of
the
wild
-
type
salKR
genes
by
the
SpcR
cassette
in
the
suspected
mutant
was
also
confirmed
by
multiple
-
PCR
analysis
and
sequencing
with
primers
specific
to
genomic
regions
lying
out
the
homologous
left
and
right
arms
(
Fig

3A
and
3E
)
.

Role
of
SalK
/
SalR
in
Virulence

The
spectinomycin
resistance
phenotype
was
stable
in
DeltasalKR
during
in
vitro
culture
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Finally
,
cell
morphology
and
ultrastructure
of
these
two
strains
were
examined
under
light
microscope
and
transmission
electron
microscope
respectively
,
however
,
no
significant
differences
were
found
(
Fig
.
4
)
.

An
experimental
infection
model
in
piglets
was
designed
to
assess
the
role
of
SalK
/
SalR
in
virulence
.

As
shown
in
Figure
5
,
all
six
SPF
-
piglets
inoculated
intravenously
with
WT
developed
most
of
the
typical
disease
symptoms
,
including
high
fever
,
limping
,
swollen
joints
,
shivering
,
CNS
failure
and
respiratory
failure
within
24
hrs
.

Wherein
the
six
piglets
challenged
with
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
were
all
alive
and
symptom
-
free
during
the
entire
course
monitored
.

The
experiments
of
functional
complementation
with
the
complemented
strain
CDeltasalKR
showed
clearly
that
the
reintroduction
of
salKR
into
DeltasalKR
restored
its
high
pathogenicity
.

Five
out
of
six
piglets
succumbed
to
the
lethal
infections
of
CDeltasalKR
and
died
,
with
median
survival
times
of
2
to
3
days
.

The
last
one
recovered
from
serious
clinical
symptoms
and
survived
at
the
experiments
end
.

To
better
evaluate
the
virulence
attenuation
of
DeltasalKR
,
colonization
experiments
were
carried
out
.

As
shown
in
Table
1
,
wild
-
type
bacteria
were
found
in
all
of
the
SS2
specific
tissues
of
WT
-
infected
piglets
,
including
heart
,
lung
,
liver
,
kidney
,
spleen
,
tonsil
,
brain
,
blood
,
joints
and
so
on
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
mutant
-
inoculated
group
,
no
mutant
bacteria
could
be
recovered
from
any
of
the
examined
tissue
specimens
.

We
anticipated
that
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
is
still
able
to
colonize
these
organs
,
is
just
due
to
the
WT
-
mediated
impairment
of
host
defense
against
SS2
infection
in
these
tissues
.

Decreased
Resistance
of
DeltasalKR
to
PMN
-
Mediated
Killing

Together
with
the
wild
type
strain
,
DeltasalKR
was
subjected
to
PMN
-
mediated
killing
assays
.

However
,
DeltasalKR
had
a
higher
mortality
rate
than
that
of
WT
,
which
means
that
DeltasalKR
was
less
able
to
resist
killing
by
PMNs
,
key
mediators
of
innate
immunity
.

To
gain
further
insights
into
the
network
/
circuit
mediated
by
SalK
/
SalR
,
whole
-
genome
DNA
microarray
was
applied
to
reveal
the
differential
transcription
profiles
between
DeltasalKR
and
WT
[
13
]
,
[
19
]
.

In
total
,
the
absence
of
SalK
/
SalR
led
to
decreased
expression
of
26
genes
spread
throughout
the
genome
(

.

%
of
the
2194
tested
)
.

Furthermore
,
orotidine

)
,
a
newly
identified
pathogenesis
-
related
protein
in
Vibrio

[

,
was
also
found
to
be
repressed
greatly
in
DeltasalKR
.

Genes
revolved
in
recombination
/
repair
and
transcription

Although
these
genes
were
found
to
be
down
-
regulated
in
the
mutant
,
it
is
not
understood
how
they
are
associated
with
the
attenuation
of
DeltasalKR
.

Genes
encoding
proteins
of
unknown
function

Several
membrane
proteins
such
as
05SSU0677
and
05SSU1912
were
also
repressed
in
DeltasalKR
.

It
is
well
documented
that
surface
proteins
or
cell
wall
-
anchored
proteins
are
usually
thought
to
contribute
to
the
immunogenicity
[
33
]
,
[
34
]
,
invasiveness
[
35
]
-
[
37
]
,
and
even
pathogenesis
[
38
]
,
[
39
]
of
pathogens
.

Moreover
,
it
should
be
noted
that
numerous
proteins
of
unknown
function
are
also
depressed
in
DeltasalKR
,
which
may
in
part
lead
to
the
virulence
loss
of
the
mutant
via
some
thus
-
far
-
unknown
mechanisms
.

As
shown
in
Table
S1
,
the
quantitative
results
of
RT
-
PCR
were
highly
compatible
to
the
microarray
data
,
in
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
,
41
out
of
42
selected
genes
(
97
.
6
%
)
were
confirmed
to
have
similar
transcript
levels
using
these
two
different
techniques
,
thus
independently
confirming
the
microarray
results
.

Discussion

Very
recently
,
Chen
et
al
.

[
6
]
reported
a
candidate
PAI
of
approximately89
kb
in
the
epidemic
outbreak
strains
of
SS2
infections
in
China
,
gave
some
genomic
clues
for
elucidating
molecular
pathways
by
which
SS2
behaved
so
aggressively
.

In
this
study
,
we
carried
out
a
detailed
structural
and
functional
analysis
of
a
unique
two
-
component
regulatory
system
designated
SalK
/
SalR
which
is
located
in
the
putative
89K
PAI
.

It
has
been
well
documented
that
horizontal
gene
transfer
events
occur
frequently
in
pathogens
[
45
]
-
[
47
]
,
and
some
of
them
have
been
implicated
in
high
pathogenicity
[
48
]
and
even
in
the
causation
of
severe
diseases
[
49
]
.

Suilysin
,
a
known
virulence
factor
,
was
believed
to
be
introduced
into
SS2
via
lateral
gene
transfer
[
43
]
.

Moreover
,
PCR
analysis
using
primers
amplifying
the
salKR
locus
also
demonstrated
that
this
TCSTS
is
specific
to
Chinese
epidemic
outbreak
strains
of
SS2
(
data
not
shown
)
,
implying
its
tight
linkage
to
the
virulence
of
this
new
emerging
pathogenic
species
.

Colonization
analysis
also
revealed
the
incapability
of
the
DeltasalKR
mutant
to
colonize
any
susceptible
tissue
of
piglets
when
administered
alone
.

These
results
indicate
definitely
that
SalK
/
SalR
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
pathogenicity
of
SS2
.

We
consider
that
the
partial
complementation
observed
in
the
piglets
infection
model
is
inherent
to
the
pleiotropic
role
of
this
regulatory
system
which
makes
it
difficult
to
restore
the
fine
tuning
of
gene
expression
as
in
the
wild
-
type
strain
.

Results
of
real
-
time
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
also
confirmed
that
,
in
the
complemented
strain
CDeltasalKR
,
only
partial
genes
identified
as
down
-
regulated
in
the
mutant
rebounded
to
comparative
transcript
levels
of
the
wild
-
type
strain
.

Those
unrecovered
genes
were
probably
irrelavent
to
the
bacterial
virulence
of
SS2
.

However
,
genes
immediately
flanking
the
salKR
locus
were
identified
as
transcriptionally
unaffected
by
the
disruption
of
the
salKR
genes
.

For
those
members
belonging
to
putative
transcriptional
operons
,
microarray
results
showed
that
most
of
those
genes
cotranscribed
with
them
were
also
down
-
regulated
to
a
various
degree
,
although
under
the
threshold
of
2
.

Further
investigation
of
other
transcriptional
alterations
observed
in
the
microarray
data
will
be
required
for
a
better
understanding
of
pathogenesis
of
this
highly
pathogenic
pathogen
.

First
,
some
pathogenic
determinants
are
environmentally
regulated
and
induced
at
specific
stages
of
the
infection
process
[
50
]
,
[
51
]
.

Secondly
,
some
of
the
TCSTSs
of
S
.
pneumoniae
were
suggested
to
be
involved
in
key
processes
of
pathogenesis
,
such
as
autolysis
and
cell
-
cell
signaling
[
52
]
,
SalK
/
SalR
might
regulate
similar
processes
in
Chinese
SS2
virulent
isolates
.

are

,
highlighting
the
importance
of
this
regulatory
system
in
vivo
.

Results
In
this
study
we
demonstrate
that
RpoE
is
involved
in
fine
-
tuning
the
expression
of
a
subset
of
SsrB
-
regulated
genes
found
in
the

that

system
,
and
unlinked
genes
integrated
into
this
regulon
that
are

Background

Salmonella
enterica
are
enteric
pathogens
that
acquired
a
type
III
secretion
system
(
T3SS
)
through
horizontal
gene
transfer
of
a
genomic
island
termed
Salmonella
Pathogenicity
Island
2
(
SPI
-
2
)
[
1
,
2
]
.

SPI
-
2
also
has
genes
,
ssrA
and
ssrB
,
which
code
for
SsrAB
,
a
two
-
component
regulatory
system
needed
for
expression
of
the
T3SS
[
6
,
7
]
.

SsrB
regulates
the
expression
of
SPI
-
2
encoded
substrate
effectors
including
ssaB
,
as
well
as
several
integrated
virulence
effectors
such
as
sseL
[
8
]
and
srfN
[
9
]
that
are
encoded
elsewhere
on
the
chromosome
but
that
have
integrated
into
the
SsrB
regulon
.

Mutants
lacking
ssrAB
are
unable
to
survive
within
macrophages
and
are
avirulent
in
mice

.

Alternative
sigma

coordinate
gene
expression
in

to
environmental

by
the

.

Sigma

have
a

[

Deletion

Taken
together
,
a
connection
between
sigmaE
and
SsrB
is
suggested
from
the
available
literature
,
however
the
role
of
sigmaE
in
activating
SsrB
-
regulated
genes
has
not
been
studied
.

By
testing
six
promoters
representing
four
classes
of
SsrB

promoters
(
(

)
two

,
and
(

)
an

)
we
demonstrate
that
RpoE
elicits
an
effect
on
a
subset
of
SsrB
-
regulated
genes
.

This
effect
was
bidirectional
depending
on
the
promoter
and
was
downstream
of
ssrB
expression
itself
,
since
deletion
of
rpoE
had
no
effect
on
SsrB
levels
in
the
mutant
cells
.

Results

To
date
,
no
sigma
factor
has
been
identified
as
regulating
SsrB
-
dependent
virulence
genes
.

To
start
,
we
first
screened
four
alternative
sigma
factor
mutants
of
S
.

For
an
rpoH
deletion
,
this
strain
was
only
viable
at
temperatures
below
30degreesC
.

Since
SPI
-
2
gene
activation
is
integrated
into
a
thermosensing
circuit
[
19
]
we
were
unable
to
test
the
role
of
sigmaH
in
this
study
(
data
not
shown
)
.

In
this
screen
,
rpoS
deletion
resulted
in
a
slight
increase
in
SseB
levels
(
Figure
1A
)
indicating
a
role
for
RpoS
in
the
repression
of
SPI
-
2
.

Both
rpoE
and
rpoN
deletions
resulted
in
decreased
SseB
levels
with
a
more
pronounced
effect
in
the
rpoE
deletion
.

An
unmarked
in
-
frame
deletion
of
rpoE
was
then
generated
in
S
.

Typhimurium
strain
SL1344
and
we
verified
that
this
in
-
frame
deletion
had
the
same
effect
on
SseB
as
the
rpoE
:
:
cat
mutant
used
previously
(
Figure
1B
)
.

To
do
this
we
examined
the
levels
of
SseL
-
2HA
,
SifA
-
2HA
and
SrfN
-
2HA
expressed
from
their
endogenous
promoters
under
SPI
-
2
inducing
conditions
(
Figure
1C
)
.

Consistent
with
the
results
for
SseB
,
there
was
a
decrease
in
SifA
-
2HA
levels
in
DeltarpoE
compared
to
wild
type
,
although
deletion
of
rpoE
did
not
have
an
effect
on
SseL
-
2HA
.

Relative
to
its
expression
in
wild
type
cells
,
the
level
of
SrfN
-
2HA
was
reproducibly
increased
in
the
DeltarpoE
cells
,
suggesting
a
role
for
sigmaE
in
the
repression
of
SrfN
,
although
it
is
unlikely
that
this
is
through
a
direct
mechanism
.

RpoE
is
involved
in
transcriptional
activity
of
a
subset
of
virulence
genes

In
order
to
confirm
the
effect
of
sigmaE
on
the
expression
of
a
broad
range
of
SsrB
-
regulated
virulence
genes
,
we
used
wild
type
and
DeltarpoE
cells
and
integrated
into
the
chromosome
individually
six
single
-
copy
transcriptional
fusions
representing
promoters
for
four
classes
of
SsrB
-
dependent
genes
or
operons
(
(
i
)
type
III
secretion
effector
operon
(
sseA
)
;
(
ii
)
structural
operon
I
(
ssaB
)
;
(
iii
)
structural
operon
II
(
ssaG
)
;
(
iv
and
v
)
effectors
encoded
outside
of
SPI
-
2
(
sseL
and
sifA
)
;
and
(
vi
)
integrated
virulence
genes
unlinked
to
SPI
-
2
(
srfN
)
[
9
]
.

The
activity
of
each
promoter
was
measured
using
a
beta
-
galactosidase
assay
during
exponential
growth
.

Although
DeltarpoE
was
observed
to
have
a
slightly
prolonged
lag
phase
relative
to
wild
type
cells
under
these
experimental
conditions
,
at
later
time
points
the
mutant
grew
similarly
to
wild
type
.

In
wild
type
cells
,
promoter
activity
from
all
the
transcriptional
fusions
was
high
,
as
expected
,
because
LPM
medium
is
highly
inducing
for
SsrB
activity
[
21
]
.

Together
,
these
data
indicate
that
sigmaE
can
have
a
variable
and
bidirectional
effect
on
SsrB
-
regulated
virulence
genes
.

The
effect
of
RpoE
on
virulence
genes
is
downstream
of
ssrB
expression

The
variable
effects
of
rpoE
deletion
on
SsrB
-
regulated
effectors
suggested
that
RpoE
might
direct
transcription
downstream
of
ssrB
expression
.

To
test
this
,
we
replaced
the
ssrB
gene
in
DeltarpoE
and
wild
type
cells
with
an
ssrB
:
:
FLAG
allele
[
19
]
and
examined
the
levels
of
SsrB
protein
in
the
strains
by
western
blot
.

Together
these
data
establish
a
role
for
RpoE
in
the
fine
-
tuning
of
virulence
gene
expression
in
S
.

Typhimurium
.

Instead
they
appeared
to
have
consensus
sites
for
sigma70
.

Due
to
the
high
degree
of
conservation
in
sigma
factor
binding
sequences
,
sigmaE
may
not
be
directly
regulating
SsrB
-
dependent
promoters
.

The
lack
of
a
canonical
sigmaE
sequence
at
these
promoters
suggests
that
another
regulatory
gene
may
be
epistatic
to
sigmaE
or
that
these
promoters
encode
functional
,
but
non
-
canonical
sigmaE
-
binding
sites
due
to
their
horizontal
acquisition
and
gradual
integration
into
the
sigmaE
regulatory
network
.

This
integration
may
help
Salmonella
coordinate
expression
of
the
virulence
-
associated
T3SS
in
response
to
host
factors
that
compromise
bacterial
membrane
integrity
(
Figure
4
)
.

This
mechanism
would
activate
a
restorative
sigmaE
pathway
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
enhanced
susceptibility
of
rpoE
mutants
to
oxidative
stress
and
antimicrobial
peptides
[
13
,
15
,
16
]
,
both
of
which
perturb
membrane
integrity
in
vivo
.

Although
there
is
no
evidence
that
sigmaE
can
directly
repress
transcription
,
the
negative
effect
on
two
promoters
observed
here
might
be
due
to
an
intermediate
RpoE
-
regulated
repressor
or
compensatory
effect
where
loss
of
rpoE
increases
the
relative
abundance
of
another
sigma
factor
that
can
directly
activate
the
ssaG
and
srfN
promoters
.

Unlinking
ssrAB
transcription
from
the
sigmaE
regulon
would
be
advantageous
to
the
cell
to
prevent
commitment
to
a
virulence
gene
expression
program
in
response
to
envelope
stress
not
associated
with
infection
.

Conclusion

Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
is
an
opportunistic
human
pathogen
that
causes
infections
in
a
variety
of
animal
and
plant
hosts
.

Caenorhabditis
elegans
is
a
simple
model
with
which
one
can
identify
bacterial
virulence
genes
.

The
selected
mutants
had
insertions
in
regulatory
genes
,
such
as
a
histidine
kinase
sensor
of
two
-
component
systems
and
a
member
of
the
AraC
family
,
or
in
genes
involved
in
adherence
or
chemotaxis
.

The
cheB2
mutant
was
tested
in
a
murine
lung
infection
model
and
found
to
have
a
highly
attenuated
virulence
.

In
P
.
aeruginosa
,
the
main
player
in
chemotaxis
and
mobility
is
the
chemotactic
gene
cluster
I
,
including
cheB1
.

We
conclude
that
the
virulence
defect
of
the
cheB2
mutant
is
not
linked
with
a
global
motility
defect
but
that
instead
the
cheB2
gene
is
involved
in
a
specific
chemotactic
response
,
which
takes
place
during
infection
and
is
required
for
P
.
aeruginosa
pathogenicity
.

Introduction

The
ubiquitous
Gram
-
negative
bacterium
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
is
an
opportunistic
pathogen
able
to
infect
a
broad
range
of
animals
and
plants
hosts
including
humans
.

Also
necessary
are
protein
secretion
systems
[
4
]
and
toxins
required
for
cytotoxicity
and
survival
within
the
host
.

P
.
aeruginosa
is
capable
of
killing
C
.
elegans
in
several
distinct
ways
.

Nematodes
exposed
to
PA14
grown
on
nematode
growth
media
(
NGM
)
,
succumb
to
"
slow
killing
"
.

Finally
,
C
.
elegans
death
,
called
red
death
,
is
observed
in
response
to
PAO1
grown
on
phosphate
-
depleted
medium
in
conjunction
with
physiological
stress
on
the
nematodes
[
10
]
.

It
is
known
that
the
P
.
aeruginosa
isolates
PA14
and
PAO1
show
genomic
diversity
.

Individual
genes
and
even
entire
genomic
islands
have
been
lost
from
laboratory
isolates
when
compared
to
pathogenic
strains
[
11
]
,
[
12
]
,
[
13
]
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
the
P
.
aeruginosa
strain
TBCF10839
(
TB
)
,
which
was
isolated
from
a
Cystic
Fibrosis
(
CF
)
patient
[
14
]
.

The
TB
strain
belongs
to
an
abundant
clonal
complex
in
the
P
.
aeruginosa
population
[
15
]
.

Increasing
throughput
in
an
assay
such
that
an
entire
genome
can
readily
be
scanned
in
a
short
time
period
is
an
important
advance
.

Our
protocol
is
based
on
a
standard
killing
assay
and
makes
use
of
a
Biosorter
to
distribute
nematodes
into
the
wells
of
microtitre
plates
in
a
fully
automated
manner
.

The
cheB2
gene
belongs
to
the
P
.
aeruginosa
chemotaxis
che2
gene
cluster
(
cluster
II
,
PA0180
-
PA0173
)
(
Figure
1
)
[
21
]
.

P
.
aeruginosa
has
multiple
copies
of
chemotaxis
genes
arranged
in
five
clusters
(
Figure
1
)
[
22
]
.

The
wsp
genes
contained
in
cluster
III
(
PA3708
-
PA3702
)
have
been
proposed
to
contribute
to
bacterial
biofilm
formation
[
25
]
,
whereas
the
cluster
IV
(
Pil
-
Chp
system
,
PA0408
-
PA0417
)
has
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
twitching
motility
[
26
]
,
[
27
]
.

In
Escherichia
coli
,
the
loss
of
CheB
leads
decreased
receptor
sensitivity
,
due
to
an
inability
to
reset
the
MCP
'
s
[
30
]
.

This
modification
leaves
the
chemotactic
pathway
in
active
states
causing
clockwise
rotation
of
the
flagella
and
continuous
tumbling
instead
of
runs
and
tumbles
.

It
has
been
reported
previously
in
Salmonella
typhimurium
that
a
loss
of
proper
chemotaxis
control
through
a
cheB
mutation
,
leads
to
a
'
tumbly
'
swimming
phenotype
and
a
strong
reduction
in
the
isolates
ability
to
invade
human
epithelial
HEP2
cells
as
well
as
a
reduction
in
infectivity
in
a
mouse
ligated
-
loop
model
[
31
]
.

In
our
study
we
further
compare
the
phenotypes
of
cheB2
and
cheB1
mutants
and
propose
that
the
cheB2
gene
has
a
specific
role
during
infection
,
which
is
essential
for
pathogenesis
.

Results

High
Throughput
Assay
for
Nematode
Killing
by
P
.
aeruginosa
It
was
reported
earlier
that
relatively
high
-
throughput
screening
procedures
performed
on
plates
could
be
used
to
identify
virulence
factors
in
various
pathogens
such
as
Staphylococcus
aureus
[
32
]
,
P
.
aeruginosa
[
8
]
or
Serratia
marcescens
[
33
]
.

Here
,
we
developed
a
high
throughput
screening
method
,
in
which
C
.
elegans
killing
is
assessed
in
a
liquid
assay
and
which
allows
a
quick
selection
of
attenuated
candidates
within
large
transposon
libraries
of
P
.
aeruginosa
.

We
filled
96
well
plates
with
the
medium
and
inoculated
the
bacterial
strains
to
be
tested
.

Under
our
assay
conditions
,
more
than
90
%
of
the
worms
grown
on
E
.
coli
were
still
alive
after
24
h
.

In
contrast
,
more
than
50
%
of
the
worms
were
killed
within
24
h
when
cultured
with
any
one
of
three
isolates
of
P
.
aeruginosa
,
PA14
,
PAO1
and
TB
(
data
not
shown
)
.

C
.
elegans
infection
using
this
mutant
in
the
liquid
assay
resulted
in
only
40
%
killing
at
24
h
,
whereas
95
%
killing
was
observed
with
the
parental
PA14
strain
(
data
not
shown
)
.

In
order
to
screen
a
large
number
of
bacterial
isolates
more
rapidly
,
the
assay
was
automated
using
the
COPAS
(
Complex
Object
Parametric
Analyzer
and
Sorter
)
Biosort
system
(
Union
Biometrica
)
(
http
:
/
/
www
.
unionbio
.
com
/
)
.

The
sorter
is
able
to
dispatch
systematically
a
fixed
number
of
worms
of
a
precise
developmental
stage
,
into
each
well
of
a
microtitre
plate
.

A
signature
tagged
mutagenesis
(
STM
)
library
was
previously
generated
in
the
virulent
P
.
aeruginosa
CF
isolate
,
TB
,
using
the
plasposon
vector
pTnModOGm
[
20
]
,
[
35
]
.

This
pre
-
screening
eliminated
clones
that
might
have
exhibited
attenuated
virulence
based
upon
reduced
growth
or
viability
,
rather
than
loss
of
a
specific
virulence
function
.

Each
mutant
was
tested
at
least
four
times
using
this
assay
.

Within
group
1
,
the
12
most
highly
attenuated
isolates
,
classified
as
group
1A
(
0
.
4
%
of
the
total
library
)
,
were
further
studied
.

Characterization
of
Selected
Attenuated
Mutants

Genomic
DNA
was
recovered
from
the
12
group
1A
isolates
.

The
transposon
insertion
site
was
determined
through
direct
genomic
DNA
sequencing
,
using
primers
located
upstream
from
each
transposon
inverted
repeat
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
.

The
genes
identified
are
shown
in
Table
1
.

We
recovered
two
additional
mutants
with
transposon
insertion
into
genes
which
have
functions
related
to
motility
.

Secondly
,
we
found
an
insertion
in
PA0173
(
cheB2
)
,
one
of
four
cheB
gene
homologues
in
the
P
.
aeruginosa
genome
sequence
.

PA0173
lies
within
the
chemotactic
gene
cluster
II
found
in
the
PAO1
genome
(
Figure
1
)
[
21
]
.

The
adaptation
of
the
chemotaxis
system
in
response
to
changes
in
attractant
binding
is
dependent
on
the
methylation
state
of
the
MCPs
.

Another
interrupted
gene
,
PA2478
,
encodes
a
probable
thiol
:
disulfide
interchange
protein
of
the
DsbD
family
.

We
observed
that
both
strains
kill
worms
with
similar
efficiency
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Each
of
the
12
group
1A
mutants
derived
from
TB
was
further
tested
in
the
slow
killing
assay
.

The
parental
TB
isolate
is
able
to
kill
50
%
of
exposed
nematodes
in
the
slow
killing
assay
within
3
days
.

Seven
of
the
twelve
group
1A
isolates
showed
significant
virulence
attenuation
(
Table
1
)
.

Phenotypic
Analysis
of
Selected
TB
mutants

It
has
been
shown
that
adherence
is
an
essential
first
step
in
the
process
of
P
.
aeruginosa
colonization
,
allowing
the
bacteria
to
persist
,
expand
in
numbers
and
develop
a
biofilm
or
establish
intimate
contact
with
host
cells
[
45
]
,
[
46
]
.

We
wished
to
determine
if
our
selected
mutants
showed
a
reduction
in
their
capacity
to
adhere
to
a
biological
surface
such
as
the
human
epithelial
cell

In
addition
to
TB4953s
(

)
and
TB0173s
(
cheB2
,
p

)
,
that
presented
strongly
reduced
adherence
,
five
other
clones
were
significantly
affected
in
their
adherence
to
cells
when
compared
to
the
parental
TB
isolate
(

These

Motility
is
also
an

factor
for

colonization
and

We
evaluated
each
of
the
twelve
attenuated
mutants
for
both
swarming
and
swimming
motility
(

(

and

and

(

(

mutants
showed
a
reduction
in
swimming
and
swarming
motility
,
respectively
.

Furthermore
,
the
mutants
TB0260s
(

and
TB5479s
(

had

(

whereas
the

(

and

(

had
a
significant
reduction
in

(

.

Characterization
of
the
cheB2
Mutant

We
chose
to
further
characterize
the
TB0173s
mutant
(
cheB2
)
,
as
this
isolate
was
affected
in
all
phenotypes
tested
and
thus
exhibited
a
general
motility
and
virulence
defect
(
Table
1
)
.

A
series
of
8
PCR
reactions
were
performed
using
oligonucleotides
based
on
the
nucleotide
sequence
obtained
from
the
PA14
genome
sequence
(
Table
S1
)
.

Each
paired
reaction
set
(
TB
/
PA14
)
resulted
in
products
running
at
the
same
migratory
rate
within
the
1
.
5
%
agarose
gel
(
data
not
shown
)
.

These
results
show
that
there
is
little
difference
between
the
two
isolates
,
TB
and
PA14
,
with
regards
the
overall
organization
of
the
che2
chromosomal
region
.

To
validate
that
the
loss
of
virulence
and
other
phenotypic
changes
observed
with
the
TB
strain
were
a
result
of
the
transposon
disruption
of
the
cheB2
gene
,
we
generated
a
new
mutant
by
interrupting
the
cheB2
gene
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
.

Both
cheB2
mutants
,
TB0173s
and
TB0173i
,
required
at
least
one
additional
day
,
as
compared
to
TB
,
to
kill
50
%
of
exposed
nematodes
.

We
reintroduced
,
in
the
cheB2
mutant
,
the
wild
-
type
cheB2
gene
using
an
integration
-
proficient
vector
,
mini
-
CTX1
[
47
]
.

This
vector
contains
the
phiCTX
attachment
site
allowing
integration
of
exogenous
DNA
fragments
at
the
attB
site
within
the
genome
of
P
.
aeruginosa
.

The
cheB2
gene
was
cloned
into
the
mini
-
CTX1
,
yielding
CTXp2B2
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
.

This
construct
was
introduced
into
the
cheB2
mutant
,
TB0173s
,
generating
the
TB0173sp2B2
strain
.

As
shown
in
Figure
3B
the
virulence
was
restored
in
the
complemented
cheB2
mutant
TB0173sp2B2
(
p
<
0
.
009
)
,
whereas
the
cheB2
mutant
strain
TB0173sCTX
(
p
<
0
.
005
)
remained
fully
attenuated
.

A

for

Virulence

We
thus
investigated
the
fate
of
a
cheB1
mutant
in
a
similar
assay
.

The
cheB1
mutant
was
used
to
feed
C
.
elegans
in
the
slow
killing
assay
and
the
survival
percentage
was
compared
to
those
obtained
when
using
the
cheB2
mutant
or
the
parental
TB
strain
(
Figure
3C
)
.

Interestingly
,
the
cheB1
mutant
showed
no
significant
reduction
in
C
.
elegans
killing
when
compared
to
the
parental
TB
strain
,
with
only
36
%
of
the
worms
alive
after
4
days
post
infection
.

This
is
in
contrast
to
the
loss
of
virulence
in
the
original
cheB2
mutant
(
TB0173s
)
and
the
insertional
cheB2
mutant
TB0173i
.

The
swimming
or
swarming
motility
defect
is
,
however
,
much
more
severe
in
the
cheB1
mutant
as
compared
to
the
cheB2
mutant
.

Finally
,
we
used
a
chemotactic
assay
using
tryptone
as
chemo
-
attractant
(
see
Materials
and
Methods
)
.

The
parental
TB
strain
was
able
to
move
towards
the
attractant
(
an
increase
of
slightly
more
than
half
a
log
of
bacteria
over
45
min
)
and
the
TB0173s
strain
(
cheB2
mutant
)
was
also
capable
of
chemotaxis
,
even
though
much
reduced
as
compared
to
TB
(
Figure
S4
)
.

We
further
tested
the
virulence
of
the
cheB2
mutant
TB0173s
in
a
mouse
model
of
lung
infection
,
utilizing
the
view
-
controlled
intratracheal
infection
protocol
[

]
.

Infection
with
the
wild
type
resulted
in
50
%
dead
animals
(

of

)
by
day

compared
to
10
%

for

(

.

Surviving
mice
infected
with
the
cheB2
mutant
showed
a
significantly
less

body
condition
from
days
3
to
6
post

than

infected
with
the
wild

strain
indicating
that
the
former
group
recovered
earlier
than
the
latter
(
Figure
4B
)
.

In
contrast
,
the
TB0173s
cheB2
mutant
had
caused
markedly
reduced
inflammation
and
very
little
PMN
infiltration
(
Figure

)
.

via

an

of

[

,
[

,
[

,
[

.

This
method
was
automated
using
the
COPAS
Biosort
worm
sorting
system
,
which
greatly
reduced
the
time
required
to
perform
the
assay
.

Under
slow
killing
conditions
(
Figure
3
)
the
TB
strain
requires
approximately
three
days
to
kill
50
%
of
a
given
worm
population
,
and
up
to
8
days
to
kill
all
the
worms
in
a
population
of
50
nematodes
.

Most
of
our
selected
mutants
were
impaired
in
at
least
one
of
the
additional
tested
phenotypes
.

One
of
the
identified
mutants
showed
reductions
in
all
aspects
of
virulence
we
tested
.

As
many
as
26
MCPs
have
been
identified
in
P
.
aeruginosa
[
56
]
,
and
it
has
been
proposed
that
the
CheB2
protein
functions
at
least
with
McpB
[
57
]
.

Interestingly
,
we
observed
that
a
mutation
in
the
cheB1
gene
yields
different
phenotypes
compared
to
the
cheB2
mutation
.

Moreover
,
it
shows
more
severe
motility
defect
than
the
cheB2
mutant
.

Finally
,
in
chemotaxis
assays
using
tryptone
as
chemo
-
attractant
,
we
observed
that
,
while
the
cheB1
mutant
was
strongly
affected
,
the
cheB2
mutant
had
a
mild
phenotype
.

Schuster
and
collaborators
have
reported
that
the
cluster
II
genes
are
induced
during
stationary
phase
,
are
regulated
by
quorum
sensing
and
that
RpoS
,
the
stationary
phase
RNA
polymerase
sigma
factor
,
plays
a
role
in
controlling
cheB2
gene
expression
[
58
]
.

RsmA
works
in
conjunction
with
small
non
-
coding
RNA
to
regulate
the
expression
of
multiple
virulence
genes
,
including
the
quorum
sensing
lasI
and
rhlI
genes
[
60
]
.

Finally
,
using
fluorescent
protein
-
tagged
CheY
and
CheA
,
it
was
shown
that
the
Che1
proteins
(
cluster
I
)
localized
to
the
flagellated
pole
throughout
growth
[
61
]
.

While
the
Che1
proteins
are
still
found
as
bacterial
cells
entered
stationary
phase
,
a
patch
of
Che2
proteins
begins
to
co
-
localize
with
the
Che1
proteins
at
that
stage
.

This
might
indicate
that
during
stationary
phase
,
the
chemotactic
response
will
be
different
than
the
one
observed
with
exponentially
growing
cells
and
the
function
of
the
Che2
cluster
,
even
though
currently
unknown
,
might
be
to
respond
to
particular
stimuli
encountered
at
that
stage
.

It
has
been
shown
that
a
cheW
mutant
in
Helicobacter
pylori
is
unable
to
establish
a
normal
long
-
term
infection
in
mice
,
remaining
only
in
one
portion
of
the
stomach
.

It
is
a
possibility
that
within
a
host
,
the
cluster
II
che
genes
of
P
.
aeruginosa
might
play
a
similar
role
in
sensing
particular
conditions
during
infection
.

Flies
orally
infected
with
P
.
entomophila
rapidly
succumb
despite
the
induction
of
both
local
and
systemic
immune
responses
,
indicating
that
this
bacterium
has
developed
specific
strategies
to
escape
the
fly
immune
response
.

We
demonstrate
that
AprA
,
an
abundant
secreted
metalloprotease
produced
by
P
.
entomophila
,
is
an
important
virulence
factor
.

Our
study
also
reveals
that
the
major
contribution
to
the
fly
defense
against
P
.
entomophila
is
provided
by
the
local
,
rather
than
the
systemic
immune
response
.

More
precisely
,
our
data
points
to
an
important
role
for
the
antimicrobial
peptide
Diptericin
against
orally
infectious
Gram
-
negative
bacteria
,
emphasizing
the
critical
role
of
local
antimicrobial
peptide
expression
against
food

borne
pathogens
.

Introduction

Host
-
pathogen
interactions
are
complex
relationships
in
which
the
success
of
each
organism
depends
on
its
ability
to
overcome
the
other
.

In
recent
years
,
Drosophila
has
emerged
as
a
powerful
model
for
the
study
of
host
-
pathogen
interactions
[
1
,
2
]
.

Firstly
,
epithelia
,
such
as
alimentary
tract
and
tracheae
,
are
the
first
line
of
defense
against
pathogens
and
produce
both
antimicrobial
peptides
(
AMPs
)
and
reactive
oxygen
species
.

Secondly
,
specialized
hemocytes
participate
in
phagocytosis
and
encapsulation
of
foreign
intruders
.

Several
genetic
studies
have
demonstrated
the
regulation
of
AMP
synthesis
by
the
Toll
and
immune
-
deficient
(
Imd
)
pathways
.

The
Toll
pathway
is
mainly
activated
by
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
and
fungi
,
and
controls
,
to
a
large
extent
,
the
expression
of
AMPs
(
e
.
g
.
,
Drosomycin
)
through
the
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
transactivators
Dif
and
Dorsal
.

In
contrast
,
the
Imd
pathway
mainly
responds
to
Gram
-
negative
bacterial
infections
and
controls
different
AMP
genes
(
e
.
g
.
,
Diptericin
)
via
the
activation
of
the
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
transactivator
Relish
(
Rel
)
[
3
,
4
,
6
]
.

In
addition
,
the
Imd
pathway
plays
a
predominant
role
in
the
regulation
of
AMPs
in
the
alimentary
tract
and
tracheal
epithelia
[
7
]
.

One
limitation
associated
with
this
approach
is
that
it
bypasses
the
initial
steps
of
naturally
occurring
infections
,
including
bacterial
colonization
and
persistence
and
host
local
immune
responses
.

Septic
injury
is
probably
of
little
consequence
in
nature
,
unlike
oral
infection
upon
ingestion
.

In
addition
,
the
response
to
non
-
pathogenic
microorganisms
does
not
necessarily
reflect
a
natural
host
reaction
to
a
real
pathogen
.

Importantly
,
in
contrast
to
Ecc15
,
P
.
entomophila
is
highly
pathogenic
for
Drosophila
as
well
as
for
species
from
a
different
insect
order
(
Lepidoptera
)
.

The
genome
sequence
of
P
.
entomophila
has
been
completed
and
reveals
the
existence
of
a
large
set
of
genes
encoding
putative
virulence
factors
such
as
proteases
,
lipases
,
toxins
,
alginate
synthesis
,
and
adhesion
factors
[
10
]
.

Transposon
mutagenesis
of
P
.
entomophila
allowed
us
to
identify
several
regulatory
genes
required
to
infect
or
to
kill
Drosophila
.

Among
them
we
identified
the
GacS
/
GacA
two
-
component
regulatory
system
which
,
in
Pseudomonas
fluorescens
,
has
been
well
characterized
and
demonstrated
to
be
an
essential
regulator
of
virulence
[
11
]
.

P
.
entomophila
gacA
mutants
are
non
-
pathogenic
and
fail
to
trigger
a
systemic
immune
response
after
ingestion
,
indicating
that
the
GacS
/
GacA
two
-
component
system
regulates
important
bacterial
virulence
effectors
required
to
infect
and
kill
flies
[

]
.

Results

P

entomophila
Secretes
an
Abundant
Protease
A
common
strategy
used
by
bacterial
pathogens
is
to
secrete
toxins
and
other
virulence
factors
that
damage
host
tissues
.

Figure
1A
shows
that
a
concentrated
P
.
entomophila
culture
filtrate
had
a
moderate
but
significant
effect
on
Drosophila
larvae
survival
following
ingestion
.

Although
the
filtrate
did
not
kill
adult
flies
after
feeding
(
unpublished
data
)
,
it
was
highly
toxic
by
direct
injection
into
the
hemocoel
(
Figure
1B
)
.

These
data
suggested
that
P
.
entomophila
secreted
one
or
more
factors
with
toxic
activity
under
the
control
of
the
GacS
/
GacA
two
-
component
system
.

In
an
attempt
to
identify
the
factor
(
s
)
responsible
for
toxicity
,
we
analyzed
the
proteins
present
in
the
supernatant
.

The
protein
profile
for
wild
-
type
P
.
entomophila
supernantant
(
Figure
1C
,
lane

)
shows
a
major
protein
band
at
51
kDa
and
several
minor
bands
.

We
subsequently
purified
this
protease
,
termed
AprA
,
to
homogeneity
from
the
P
.
entomophila
supernatant
by
anion
exchange
chromatography
followed
by
size
exclusion
chromatography
(

)
.

Feeding
of
larvae
with
high
concentrations
(
1
.
5
mg
/

)
of
AprA
led
to
modest
lethality
(
unpublished

)
,
recapitulating
the
properties
of
the
P

the

resulting
in

of
multiple
genes
,
including
one
encoding
for
a

,
aprX
[
16
]
.

Interestingly
,
both
prtR
mutants
(
CL25
and
CU1
)
displayed
a
secreted
protein
profile
identical
to
the
wild

type
strain
except
for
a
marked
decrease
of
AprA
(
Figure

,
lanes
4
and
5
)
.

Measurement
of
in
vitro
protease
activity
with
azocasein
revealed
that
the
gacA
mutant
secretes
no
detectable
protease
activity
and
that
prtR
mutants
retain
only
30
%
of
wild

activity
,
thus
indicating
a
role
for
PrtR
in
the
regulation
of
P

(

.

The

Mutant
Displays
Attenuated
Pathogenicity

We
inactivated
the
aprA
gene
by
inserting
a
tetracycline
resistance
cassette
by
a
double
homologous
recombination
event
.

To
analyze
the
in
vivo
contribution
of
AprA
to
P
.
entomophila
virulence
,
we
performed
a
survival
analysis
of
Drosophila
larvae
and
adults
after
oral
infection
with
various
P
.
entomophila
derivatives
.

Similarly
,
the
aprA
mutant
showed
reduced
pathogenicity
after
oral
infection
of
adult
flies
(
Figure
S1
)
.

Using
the
same
assay
,
both
prtR
and
gacA
mutants
were
almost
avirulent
toward
Drosophila
indicating
that
both
genes
regulate
other
virulence
factors
in
addition
to
AprA
(
Figure
2B
)
.

Whereas
the
wild
-
type
P
.
entomophila
titer
remained
high
,
aprA
bacterial
levels
decreased
significantly
with
time
(
Figure
3A
,
not
shown
for
larvae
)
.

However
,
aprA
gut
persistence
remained
higher
than
that
of
gacA
mutants
.

We
could
not
exclude
that
the
aprA
mutant
phenotype
was
due
to
polar
effects
of
the
insertion
in
the
operon
upon
expression
of
apr

The
aprA
Mutant
Retains
the
Capacity
to
Trigger
an
Immune
Response
and
to
Induce
Food
-
Uptake
Cessation

In
addition
to
its
pathogenicity
,
P
.
entomophila
infection
provokes
a
food
-
uptake
cessation
in
larvae
and
triggers
an
immune
response
in
both
larvae
and
adults
[
9
]
.

In
contrast
,
P
.
entomophila
-
infected
larvae
show
only
a
pale
blue
coloration
indicating
that
infected
larvae
cease
to
ingest
food
.

Diptericin
was
expressed
at
a
wild
-
type
level
following
oral
infection
with
the
aprA
and
prtR
mutants
,
but
no
expression
was
detected
in
the
case
of
the
gacA
mutant
(
Figures
2C
and
5A
)
.

Observation
of
green
fluorescent
protein
(
GFP
)
fluorescence
in
infected
larvae
carrying
a
Diptericin
-
GFP
reporter
gene
confirmed
that
prtR
and
aprA
mutants
elicited
an
immune
response
,
whereas
gacA
mutants
failed
to
do
so
(
unpublished
data
)
.

The
data
presented
above
clearly
indicate
that
AprA
is
a
major
virulence
factor
of
P
.
entomophila
that
promotes
bacterial
persistence
and
killing
of
the
host
,
but
that
other
virulence
factors
controlled
by
gacA
and
prtR
exist
.

It
also
reveals
that
P
.
entomophila
virulence
is
multi
-
factorial
with
a
clear
distinction
between
factors
that
promote
pathogenicity
and
those
that
trigger
the
immune
response
.

The
observation
that
both
factors
are
under
the
control
of
the
GacS
/
GacA
,
confirmed
that
this
two
-
component
system
is
the
master
regulator
of
P
.
entomophila
virulence
.

Virulence
factors
allow
pathogens
to
survive
in
the
hostile
environment
of
the
host
,
to
escape
the
immune
system
,
or
to
establish
a
biotope
where
they
can
proliferate
by
altering
host
functions
.

The
observation
that
P
.
entomophila
persistence
in
flies
and
larvae
is
lower
in
aprA
mutants
clearly
indicates
that
the
AprA
protease
promotes
bacterial
persistence
in
the
Drosophila
gut
.

Whereas
the
titer
of
gacA
mutants
decreased
with
time
,
we
observed
that
the
aprA
derivative
persisted
at
a
level
similar
to
wild
-
type
bacteria
in
Rel
-
deficient
mutant
flies
and
larvae
(
Figure
3A
and
3B
,
and
unpublished
data
)
.

P
.
entomophila
infection
triggers
Imd
pathway
activation
within
hours
.

To
determine
at
which
time
Imd
was
required
to
impede
P
.
entomophila
infection
,
we
monitored
survival
to
P
.
entomophila
in
flies
in
which
the
Imd
pathway
was
artificially
activated
in
a
time
-
dependent
manner
.

It
further
suggests
that
P
.
entomophila
is
sensitive
to
immune
defenses
during
a
short
time
frame
and
subsequently
becomes
insensitive
.

Since
P
.
entomophila
is
pathogenic
under
normal
wild
-
type
conditions
,
it
may
overcome
the
immune
response
by
establishing
a
niche
in
the
gut
before
the
Imd
pathway
is
activated
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
agreement
with
the
results
described
above
,
persistence
of
both
the
aprA
mutant
and
wild
-
type
bacteria
was
significantly
altered
in
fly
lines
over
-
expressing
the
Imd
pathway
,
and
that
aprA
mutants
survived
less
than
wild
-
type
bacteria
(
Figure
4B
)
.

Local
,
but
Not
Systemic
Immunity
,
Contributes
to
Resistance
against
Oral
Infection
with
P
.
entomophila

P
.
entomophila
,
but
not
the
gacA
derivative
,
rapidly
activates
both
the
local
and
systemic
Imd
-
dependent
immune
responses
in
Drosophila
adults
,
which
can
be
demonstrated
using
RT
-
qPCR
with
fat
body
and
gut
extracts
(
Figure
5A
)
.

This
suggests
a
critical
role
of
this
organ
in
the
elimination
of
bacteria
.

We
thus
compared
resistance
to
P
.
entomophila
infection
of
flies
that
were
previously
either
orally
infected
with
Ecc15
(
to
activate
a
local
immune
response
)
or
pricked
with
Ecc15
(
to
activate
a
systemic
immune
response
)
.

The
rationale
behind
this
experiment
is
based
on
previous
observations
that
an
oral
infection
with
Ecc15
triggers
a
local
,
but
not
a
systemic
immune
response
at
the
adult
stage
(
our
unpublished
data
)
[
8
]
.

Figure
5C
shows
that
a
prior
infection
with
Ecc15
protected
flies
against
a
subsequent
P
.
entomophila
infection
only
when
Ecc15
was
administrated
orally
,
indicating
that
the
local
,
but
not
the
systemic
immune
response
,
plays
an
important
role
in
P
.
entomophila
clearance
.

We
used
the
evf
-
deficient
derivative
because
this
bacterium
triggers
a
local
immune
response
without
persisting
in
the
gut
.

This
experiment
shows
that
wild
-
type
,
but
not
Rel
flies
previously
infected
with
Ecc15
evf
-
,
resisted
a
second
challenge
by
P
.
entomophila
(
Figure
5D
)
.

This
demonstrates
that
the
protection
was
indeed
due
to
Imd
pathway
activation
in
the
gut
.

However
,
the
previous
results
did
not
address
whether
the
Imd
pathway
induced
during
the
course
of
a
natural
P
.
entomophila
infection
contributes
to
fly
resistance
to
P
.
entomophila
.

These
flies
lack
a
functional
Imd
pathway
except
in
the
gut
where
cad
-
Gal4
is
expressed
.

In
these
flies
,
the
Imd
pathway
was
not
constitutively
active
in
the
gut
but
could
be
induced
upon
oral
bacterial
infection
similarly
to
the
wild
-
type
situation
(
Figure
S3A
)
.

Figure
5E
shows
that
Rel
flies
expressing
Rel
in
the
gut
survive
better
than
Rel
mutant
flies
.

We
have
shown
that
AprA
protects
P
.
entomophila
against
the
Imd
-
regulated
immune
response
.

This
immune
pathway
regulates
the
expression
of
several
AMP
genes
,
as
well
as
many
other
immune
genes
.

Previous
studies
indicated
that
Attacin
A
and
Diptericin
are
the
AMP
genes
most
strongly
induced
in
the
gut
following
ingestion
of
infectious
bacteria
[
7
]
.

It
has
also
been
suggested
that
proteases
homologous
to
AprA
in
other
bacterial
species
degrade
AMPs
in
vitro
,
thereby
enabling
pathogens
to
withstand
the
attack
of
the
host
immune
system
[
20
,
21
]
.

This
strategy
allowed
us
to
study
the
contribution
of
each
antibacterial
peptide
to
the
defense
against
a
P
.
entomophila
infection
.

Ubiquitous
expression
of
Attacin
A
and
Diptericin
with
the
da
-
Gal4
driver
greatly
increased
the
resistance
of
imd
mutant
flies
(
Figure
6A
)
.

Importantly
,
it
also
reveals
for
the
first
time
a
major
contribution
of
Diptericin
to
host
defense
,
which
was
not
previously
detected
using
systemic
injection
of
microbes
[
22
]
.

Figure
6B
shows
that
the
aprA
mutant
persisted
less
well
than
wild
-
type
bacteria
in
imd
flies
over
-
expressing
Diptericin
.

Altogether
,
our
results
provide
an
in
vivo
demonstration
that
AprA
functions
in
the
protection
of
P
.
entomophila
against
Drosophila
AMPs
.

Discussion

Pathogens
have
developed
a
plethora
of
strategies
that
allow
them
to
exploit
host
resources
and
resist
the
attacks
of
the
host
immune
response
.

To
study
how
flies
deal
with
infections
in
a
natural
context
,
we
investigated
the
interactions
between
Drosophila
and
a
newly
identified
entomopathogen
,
P
.
entomophila
.

Local
Expression
of
AMP
Genes
Plays
a
Major
Role
against
Food
-
Borne
Infections
The
use
of
GFP
reporter
transgenes
in
Drosophila
has
revealed
that
,
in
addition
to
the
fat
body
,
AMP
genes
can
be
expressed
in
several
barrier
epithelia
that
are
in
direct
contact
with
microorganisms
from
the
environment
[
7
,
23
]
.

The
present
study
demonstrates
a
key
role
for
the
local
Imd
immune
response
in
the
gut
against
oral
infection
by
bacterial
pathogens
.

The
Imd
pathway
regulates
a
large
number
of
immune
genes
including
those
encoding
AMPs
;
and
two
peptides
,
Diptericin
and
Attacin
,
are
preferentially
synthesized
following
bacterial
infection
in
the
digestive
tract
of
Drosophila
[
7
]
.

It
is
also
possible
that
Diptericin
could
reach
high
concentration
levels
in
restricted
areas
of
the
Drosophila
gut
such
as
the
proventriculus
and
thus
be
more
effective
against
pathogens
than
in
other
body
compartments
.

Our
study
suggests
that
Diptericin
expression
in
the
anterior
gut
provides
an
efficient
early
barrier
allowing
Drosophila
to
rapidly
eliminate
most
ingested
bacteria
.

Finally
,
it
remains
surprising
that
P
.
entomophila
infection
triggers
a
systemic
immune
response
that
has
no
overt
function
against
the
bacteria
that
remain
in
the
gut
lumen
.

This
response
could
be
interpreted
as
anticipation
of
possible
breaching
of
the
gut
barrier
.

Alternatively
,
our
results
suggest
the
possibility
that
bacteria
such
as
P
.
entomophila
may
subvert
insect
host
defenses
by
triggering
this
systemic
response
.

This
can
be
compared
with
many
human
pathogens
for
which
activation
of
an
inflammatory
response
represents
a
part
of
their
invasive
strategy
[
25
]
.

Proteases
,
especially
metalloproteases
,
are
also
known
to
contribute
to
virulence
in
some
pathogenic
bacteria
including
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
,
S
.
marcescens
,
and
Bacillus
thuringiensis
[
20
,
21
,
26
]
.

Molecular
mechanisms
for
pathogenesis
attributed
to
these
proteases
include
degradation
of
structural
matrices
and
destruction
of
proteins
involved
in
host
protective
functions
such
as
AMPs
or
complement
factors
.

However
,
in
most
cases
,
attempts
to
evaluate
the
role
of
metalloproteases
in
virulence
have
failed
to
obtain
conclusive
results
with
respect
to
a
specific
function
[
20
,
21
]
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
S
.
marcescens
,
another
potent
oral
pathogen
of
Drosophila
,
also
expresses
a
protease
that
can
degrade
AMPs
in
vitro
[
12
]
.

However
,
in
the
absence
of
a
Serratia
protease
mutant
,
the
in
vivo
relevance
of
the
protease
is
not
yet
established
.

We
cannot
exclude
that
AprA
degrades
other
immune
effectors
or
participates
directly
as
a
toxic
factor
by
degrading
the
gut
epithelium
or
the
peritrophic
matrix
.

In
B
.
thuringiensis
,
it
has
been
proposed
that
the
protease
InhA2
participates
in
the
degradation
of
the
gut
,
thus
facilitating
the
action
of
the
Cry
toxins
[
27
,
28
]
.

The
observation
that
injection
of
AprA
into
the
hemocoel
is
lethal
to
adult
flies
supports
the
hypothesis
of
additional
roles
for
the
protease
in
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

However
,
oral
ingestion
of
purified
AprA
induces
only
low
levels
of
lethality
,
indicating
that
AprA
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
kill
the
host
via
this
route
of
entry
,
and
other
factors
participate
in
oral
toxicity
.

In
a
gacA
mutant
background
,
AprA
synthesis
is
not
restored
when
a
plasmid
with
the
aprA
locus
is
expressed
in
trans
(
unpublished
data
)
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
post
-
transcriptional
regulation
of
aprA
by
gacA
via
the
two
small
non
-
coding
RNAs
RsmY
and
RsmZ
[
11
]
.

As
opposed
to
the
pleiotropic
effects
of
GacS
/
GacA
,
PrtR
appears
to
be
a
more
specific
regulator
of
aprA
expression
in
P
.
entomophila
,
reminiscent
of
aprX
regulation
in
P
.
fluorescens
[
32
]
.

Many
pseudomonads
and
other
bacteria
express
proteases
similar
to
AprA
but
are
not
able
to
infect
Drosophila
by
oral
ingestion
.

The
difference
in
pathogenicity
exhibited
by
gacA
,
prtR
,
and
aprA
mutants
underlines
the
complexity
of
P
.
entomophila
virulence
factors
.

Our
results
indicate
that
the
GacS
/
GacA
two
-
component
system
regulates
one
or
several
genes
that
promote
bacterial
survival
in
the
gut
.

Since
gacA
mutants
did
not
persist
in
imd
-
deficient
mutant
hosts
,
we
speculate
that
this
persistence
-
promoting
factor
provides
general
protection
against
gut
intestinal
conditions
rather
than
a
specific
protection
against
the
fly
immune
response
.

Food
-
uptake
cessation
or
blockage
in
insects
is
induced
by
several
other
entomopathogenic
bacteria
including
S
.
entomophila
and
Yersinia
pestis
,
enabling
persistence
in
the
digestive
tract
of
their
insect
hosts
[
35
,
36
]
.

This
observation
suggests
that
peristaltic
movements
of
the
gut
may
also
play
an
important
role
in
the
elimination
of
bacteria
,
and
that
entomopathogens
have
developed
strategies
to
abrogate
these
movements
.

Determining
the
cause
of
this
food
-
uptake
cessation
and
its
possible
link
to
the
persistence
-
promoting
factor
will
be
essential
for
the
elucidation
of
the
initial
events
involved
in
gut
colonization
.

This
confirms
the
existence
of
other
bacterial
virulence
factors
.

Therefore
,
it
remains
to
be
determined
whether
the
strategies
developed
by
P
.
entomophila
to
persist
in
the
larval
gut
and
to
kill
its
host
involves
genes
related
to
those
identified
in
other
entomopathogenic
bacteria
and
how
the
different
factors
contribute
to
pathogenesis
.

Application
of
this
method
to
Escherichia
coli
motility
identifies
95
%
of
the
known
flagellar
and
chemotaxis
genes
,
and
reveals
three
dozen
novel
loci
that
,
to
varying
degrees
and
through
diverse
mechanisms
,
affect
motility
.

This
allows
us
to
place
the
novel
genes
within
the
context
of
signaling
and
regulatory
networks
,
including
the
Rcs
phosphorelay
pathway
and
the
cyclic
di
-
GMP
second
-
messenger
system
.

These
behaviors
are
contingent
on
sophisticated
sensory
systems
that
maximize
fitness
in
the
complex
and
highly
dynamic
environments
where
physical
,
chemical
,
and
biological
parameters
change
on
many
different
time
scales
.

Modern
genetic
and
molecular
studies
have
largely
focused
on
a
limited
repertoire
of
behaviors
of
a
few
model
organisms
in
the
non
-
native
context
of
the
laboratory
.

Chemotaxis
,
the
capacity
to
move
up
and
down
chemical
gradients
,
is
widespread
in
the
bacterial
world
.

An
impressive
achievement
of
20th
-
century
biology
was
a
systems
-
level
understanding
of
bacterial
chemotaxis
in
terms
of
the
structures
,
interactions
,
and
organization
of
the
roughly
50
constituent
molecular
components
[
2
-
4
]
.

When
the
filament
rotates
in
the
counterclockwise
(
CCW
)
direction
,
as
viewed
from
outside
the
cell
,
a
helical
wave
travels
down
the
filament
away
from
the
cell
body
.

The
direction
of
rotation
is
influenced
by
the
output
of
the
chemotaxis
network
,
which
consists
of
a
signal
transduction
cascade
that
allows
robust
adaptation
to
local
concentrations
of
ligands
over
many
orders
of
magnitude
[
7
,
8
]
.

When
cells
detect
an
increase
in
the
concentration
of
an
attractant
,
tumbling
is
suppressed
so
as
to
allow
cells
to
migrate
towards
the
source
through
the
statistical
strategy
of
a
biased
random
walk
[
9
]
.

These
events
yield
an
orderly
"
just

"
expression
and
assembly
of
the
flagellar
components
[
11
]
,
which
consist
of
a
basal
body
complex
and
a
filament
.

The
identification
of
the
molecular
components
and
their
organization
into
the
two
dominant
modules
-
the
chemotaxis
network
and
the
flagellum
/
basal
body
/
motor
system
-
took
the
better
part
of
40
years
and
the
work
of
dozens
of
laboratories
.

To
fully
identify
the
genetic
determinants
for
this
phenotype
,
a
library
of
transposon
-
mutagenized
cells
was
functionally
enriched
en
masse
for
impaired
swimming
and
surface
-
mediated
swarming
motility
.

Further
characterization
of
these
novel
genes
revealed
that
they
impair
motility
through
diverse
mechanisms
such
as
disrupting
signaling
through
phosphorelay
cascades
,
altering
concentrations
of
the
recently
appreciated
cyclic
di
-
GMP
(
c
-
di
-
GMP
)
second
messenger
,
and
by
mechanisms
that
have
yet
to
be
revealed
.

Subsequent

analyses
allow
us
to
organize
the
discovered
loci
into
signaling
and
regulatory
pathways

transposon
-
mutagenized
cells
throughout
a
competitive
selection
experiment
[
12
]
.

Given
the
reduced
target
specificity
and
a
genome
of
approximately
4
,
300
genes
,
the
mutagenesis
of
our
library
is
saturating
with
an
average
of
approximately100
independent
insertions
within
each
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
.

In
each
of
our
experiments
,
a
population
of
mutants
is
challenged
for
competitive
growth
under
a
selection
of
interest
.

Each
mutant
within
the
population
is
uniquely
defined
by
the
local
sequence
flanking
the
transposon
insertion
site
.

The
series
of
molecular
manipulations
detailed
in
Figure
S1
allow
the
amplification
of
roughly
200
base
pairs
flanking
each
transposon
insertion
site
in
a
population
in
parallel
.

As
a
consequence
of
selection
,
individual
insertional
mutants
can
increase
or
decrease
in
abundance
during
the
course
of
an
experiment
,
and
these
relative
changes
can
be
monitored
by
comparing
genome
-
wide
hybridization
values
before
and
after
selection
.

To
determine
the
degree
to
which
each
gene
contributes
to
fitness
under
a
particular
selection
,
we
quantify
the
extent
of
enrichment
or
depletion
of
all
transposon
insertions
within
a
gene
after
a
selection
is
imposed
.

We
assign
the
total
hybridization
signal
for
each
ORF
on
the
array
as
the
sum
of
contributions
from
all
the
mutants
that
harbor
an
insertion
somewhere
within
or
in
close
proximity
to
the
ORF
.

ORFs
that
harbor
deleterious
mutations
during
the
selection
will
have
negative
z
-
scores
(
corresponding
to
depletion
)
,
whereas
ORFs
that
harbor
relatively
favorable
mutations
during
the
selection
will
have
positive
z
-
scores
(
corresponding
to
enrichment
)
.

Genetic
Basis
of
Swimming
Motility
and
Chemotaxis

Semi
-
solid
tryptone
agar
provides
a
robust
setting
for
studying
E
.
coli
chemotaxis
.

Once
inoculated
into
a
region
of
the
soft
agar
,
bacteria
deplete
local
nutrients
and
chemotax
radially
outward
following
the
concentration
gradient
of
preferred
substrates
[
17
]
.

To
systematically
and
completely
identify
the
genetic
determinants
for
swimming
motility
,
approximately107
cells
of
the
mutant
library
were
functionally
enriched
en
masse
for
an
impaired
ability
to
swim
through
soft
agar
.

The
percentage
of
nonmotile
mutants
was
determined
after
each
stage
of
enrichment
by
a
clonal
plating
assay
and
,
after
five
stages
,
96
%
of
the
mutants
showed
an
impaired
ability
to
swim
(
Figure
S3
)
.

The
amplification
of
transposon
insertion
sites
from
a
small
sample
of
these
mutants
showed
that
the
nonmotile
phenotype
is
the
result
of
a
single
gene
disruption
in
each
mutant
.

As
expected
,
the
vast
majority
of
these
disruptions
occurred
in
previously
known
flagellar
or
chemotaxis
genes
(
Table
S3
)
.

However
,
even
in
this
small
sample
,
we
found
transposon
insertions
in
genes
without
a
previously
known
role
in
motility
.

To
obtain
a
genome
-
wide
catalog
of
loci
involved
in
swimming
motility
,
we
applied
our
microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
assay
to
the
population
of
mutants
at
the
end
of
the
enrichments
.

However
,
of
the
115
ORFs
with
z
-
scores
greater
than
12
,
49
are
known
flagellar
and
chemotaxis
genes
.

Since
the
microarray
contained
52
out
of
the
total
of
54
known
motility
genes
[
18
]
,
the
chance
likelihood
of
observing
this
level
of
enrichment
was
extremely
low
(
p
<
10
-
76
)
.

We
confirmed
this
expectation
by
showing
that
deletions
of
fliT
and
aer
did
not
affect
motility
(
data
not
shown
)
.

The
neutral
behavior
of
the
fliT
mutation
is
not
surprising
since
fliT
null
strains
were
found
to
make
functional
flagella
in
S
.
enterica
[
19
]
.

In
addition
,
it
has
been
reported
that
fliT
mutations
enhance
expression
of
class
2
flagellar
operons
[
20
]
because
FliT
acts
as
a
negative
regulator
of
these
operons
by
binding
to
and
inhibiting
the
activity
of
FlhDC
[
21
]
.

The
protein
encoded
by
aer
mediates
oxygen
and
redox
sensing
,
and
as
such
shares
overlapping
function
with
the
Tsr
receptor
[
22
]
.

Remarkably
,
the
selection
results
revealed
many
genes
with
high
z
-
scores
without
a
previously
known
role
in
motility
.

To
minimize
such
false
positives
,
we
demanded
that
a
candidate
motility
gene
obtain
a
z
-
score
above
12
in
at
least
two
of
the
three
replicate
selections
(
Datasets
S2
,
S3
,
and
S4
)
.

We
observed
that
some
false
positives
were
indeed
due
to
hitchhiking
,
but
others
were
due
to
polar
effects
of
transposon
insertions
on
downstream
genes
within
operons
.

However
,
the
number
of
false
positives
can
be
driven
lower
by
decreasing
the
cycles
of
selection
,
increasing
the
number
of
replicates
,
or
by
focusing
on
genes
with
relatively
high
z
-
scores
.

In
the
sections
that
follow
,
we
explore
the
manner
in
which
the
validated
newly
identified
genes
affect
motility
.

Bacteriophage
chi
infects
E
.
coli
by
attaching
to
and
traveling
along
flagellar
filaments
[
24
]
.

The
library
of
transposon
insertional
mutants
was
exposed
to
chi
-
phage
in
an
environment
conducive
to
motility
(
Figure
2A
)
.

Figure
2B
shows
the
distribution
of
z
-
scores
after
library
selection
upon
exposure
to
bacteriophage
chi
,
and
the
complete
microarray
results
for
duplicate
selections
can
be
found
in
Datasets
S5
and
S6
.

As
expected
,
insertional
mutations
in
flagellar
genes
conferred
resistance
to
chi
-
phage
infection
.

This
is
to
be
expected
,
since
null
mutations
in
these
genes
do
not
entirely
abolish
CCW
flagellar
rotation
.

The
only
exception
among
the
che
genes
is
cheZ
,
whose
z
-
score
of
+
8
.
7
indicates
a
CW
flagellar
rotation
bias
and
reduced
susceptibility
to
chi
-
phage
infection
.

Therefore
,
in
the
absence
of
CheZ
,
CheY
is
maintained
in
the
phosphorylated
state
,
"
locking
"
flagellar
rotation
in
the
CW
direction
,
and
hence
minimizing
infection
by
chi
-
phage
.

The
role
these
structures
play
in
chi
-
phage
infection
and
the
impact
they
have
on
motility
are
discussed
in
a
separate
section
below
.

Genetic
Basis
of
Swarming
Motility

Swarming
is
exhibited
by
many
flagellated
bacteria
,
and
is
defined
as
a
coordinated
multicellular
migration
across
a
solid
surface
by
morphologically
differentiated
cells
[
28
]
.

Confocal
fluorescence
microscopy
shows
swarming
cells
aligning
themselves
lengthwise
and
moving
coordinately
in
groups
,
forming
"
rafts
"
(
Movie
S1
)
.

In
this
context
,
the
cells
appear
to
execute
smooth
swimming
behavior
almost
exclusively
,
in
contrast
to
the
extensive
switching
back
and
forth
seen
during
chemotaxis
.

Aside
from
the
requirement
for
flagella
,
other
aspects
of
the
behavior
are
poorly
understood
.

Because
the
genetic
basis
of
swarming
is
not
well
characterized
,
this
behavior
is
well
suited
for
comprehensive
analysis
using
our
approach
.

A
single
round
of
enrichment
consisted
of
inoculating
our
library
of
E
.
coli
mutants
onto
the
center
of
agar
plates
,
incubating
the
plates
to
allow
the
cells
to
migrate
outward
from
the
site
of
inoculation
,
and
transferring
bacteria
from
the
original
area
of
inoculation
to
a
fresh
plate
.

After
twenty
rounds
of
daily
successive
transfers
(
Figure
3A
)
,
more
than
90
%
of
the
population
exhibited
a
defect
in
swarming
(
Figure
S5
)
.

As
expected
,
the
selection
results
were
dominated
by
flagellar
and
chemotaxis
genes
(
Figure
3B
)
.

While
mutants
with
a
defect
in
the
flagellar
apparatus
did
not
swarm
,
chemotaxis
mutants
formed
swarming
patterns
as
finger
-
like
projections
,
in
contrast
to
the
more
uniform
swarming
patterns
generated
by
the
wild
-
type
parent
strain
(
Figure
3C
)
.

These
observations
indicate
that
the
chemotaxis
sensory
system
and
flagellar
switching
have
an
effect
on
,
but
are
not
critical
for
,
surface
motility
.

Novel
Genes
Implicated
in
Swimming
,
Swarming
,
and
chi
-
Phage
Infection

For
example
,
of
the
20
non
-
flagellar
genes
revealed
to
affect
swimming
motility
,
twelve
encode
constituents
of
the
inner
membrane
and
periplasmic
space
.

Surprisingly
,
while
mutants
with
deletions
of
rcsD
,
sdaC
,
tatA
,
and
yhjH
were
impaired
in
swimming
,
these
mutants
swarmed
normally
(
unpublished
data
)
.

Interrogation
of
genes
with
high
z
-
scores
in
the
enrichment
for
mutants
incapable
of
swarming
identified
two
additional
genes
that
impact
surface
motility
:
hns
,
encoding
a
global
transcriptional
regulator
,
and
yfiR
,
encoding
a
predicted
periplasmic
protein
of
unknown
function
.

In
-
frame
deletions
of
these
genes
abolished
swarming
;
however
,
while
the
Deltahns
mutant
showed
a
severe
swimming
defect
,
the
swimming
motility
of
the
DeltayfiR
mutant
was
only
mildly
impaired
(
Figures
3D
and
4
)
.

Among
the
loci
exhibiting
high
z
-
scores
after
chi
-
phage
selection
were
the
rfa
and
mdo
gene
clusters
responsible
for
the
structural
assembly
of
lipopolysaccharides
(
LPS
)
and
osmoregulated
periplasmic
glucans
(
OPG
)
.

Genes
involved
with
the
synthesis
of
LPS
and
OPG
precursors
(
hldD
,
hldE
,
galU
,
gmhA
,
gmhB
,
and
pgm
)
were
also
highly
abundant
after
chi
-
phage
selection
.

To
investigate
this
possibility
,
we
introduced
flhDC
-
lacZ
translational
fusions
in
the
deletion
strains
and
performed
beta
-
galactosidase
assays
.

Surprisingly
,
a
large
fraction
of
the
mutants
tested
showed
significant
reduction
in
flhDC
-
lacZ
expression
values
relative
to
the
wild
-
type
strain
,
demonstrating
that
the
motility
defects
can
be
partly
attributed
to
reduced
expression
of
the
flhDC
operon
.

In
addition
,
we
noticed
that
LPS
mutants
varied
widely
in
flhDC
expression
and
that
the
repression
of
this
operon
,
and
the
corresponding
motility
defect
,
were
related
to
the
degree
of
LPS
truncation
(
Figure
4
)
.

LPS
and
OPG
Mutations
Impair
Motility
by
Repressing
Flagellar
Gene
Expression
through
the
Rcs
Signaling
Pathway

To
determine
the
role
of
the
Rcs
signaling
pathway
in
LPS
/
OPG
mediated
repression
of
motility
,
we
disrupted
each
of
the
components
of
the
Rcs
system
in
most
of
our
LPS
and
OPG
mutants
.

We
found
that
deletion
of
rcsB
,
rcsD
,
or
rcsF
was
sufficient
to
rescue
motility
in
both
LPS
and
OPG
mutants
(
Figure
S6
)
,
providing
strong
evidence
that
perturbations
in
these
structures
repress
motility
by
signaling
through
the
Rcs
pathway
.

This
observation
is
consistent
with
the
dual
functional
role
of
RcsC
as
both
kinase
and
phosphatase
,
moving
phosphates
both
to
and
away
from
RcsB
via
RcsD
,
and
that
RcsB
remains
phosphorylated
in
rcsC
null
mutants
[
38
,
39
]
.

This
conclusion
is
further
supported
by
the
dramatic
reduction
in
swimming
motility
by
rcsC137
mutants
(
Figure
S7
)
,
in
which
the
rcsC137
gene
product
has
lost
its
phosphatase
activity
[
40
]
.

The
chi
-
phage
selection
results
suggest
that
LPS
and
OPG
are
necessary
for
infection
.

However
,
since
functional
flagella
are
a
prerequisite
for
chi
-
phage
infection
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
defects
in
LPS
and
OPG
affect
chi
-
phage
infection
directly
or
whether
the
observed
selection
results
are
primarily
due
to
reduced
flagellar
expression
.

To
evaluate
the
necessity
of
LPS
and
OPG
for
phage
infection
,
we
needed
mutants
that
were
defective
in
these
structures
but
still
synthesized
functional
flagella
and
were
motile
.

An
flhD
mutant
was
used
as
a
chi
-
phage
-
resistant
control
and
,
as
expected
,
showed
no
sensitivity
,
whereas
chi
-
phage
multiplied
rapidly
in
the
presence
of
the
wild
-
type
strain
(
Figure
5A
)
.

Both
OPG
and
LPS
mutants
showed
decreased
sensitivity
to
chi
-
phage
,
and
the
decrease
in
sensitivity
was
eliminated
by
introducing
DeltarcsF
deletions
,
indicating
that
OPG
and
LPS
are
not
directly
required
for
chi
-
phage
infection
(
Figures
5B
-
D
)
.

We
also
observed
that
sensitivity
to
chi
-
phage
was
higher
in
rfaI
mutants
than
rfaC
mutants
,
indicating
that
chi
-
phage
infectivity
is
directly
related
to
the
degree
of
flhDC
expression
(
Figures
4
,
5B
,
and
5C
)
.

In
a
previous
study
,
the
swarming
deficiency
of
LPS
mutants
had
suggested
an
essential
role
for
LPS
in
swarming
behavior
[
41
]
.

To
test
whether
such
a
direct
role
exists
,
we
interrogated
our
collection
of
LPS
and
OPG
mutants
for
swarming
proficiency
.

yhjH
Affects
Flagellar
Motor
Bias

Mutations
in
yhjH
were
recently
found
to
impair
swimming
motility
[
42
]
.

Surprisingly
,
this
gene
showed
a
negative
z
-
score
of
-
8
after
bacteriophage
chi
selection
,
indicating
that
this
mutant
is
impaired
in
swimming
motility
but
may
show
increased
susceptibility
to
chi
-
phage
infection
relative
to
the
wild
-
type
strain
.

Electron
microscopy
of
DeltayhjH
mutants
showed
the
appearance
of
flagella
,
and
light
microscopy
showed
vigorous
cellular
movement
(
unpublished
data
)
,
indicating
that
the
flagella
are
capable
of
rotating
;
still
,
this
mutant
exhibited
severe
impairment
in
swimming
(
Figure
1C
)
.

To
determine
whether
the
absence
of
yhjH
alters
the
direction
of
flagellar
rotation
,
several
functional
studies
were
performed
.

Second
,
while
DeltayhjH
mutants
are
impaired
in
swimming
motility
,
they
did
not
show
a
measurable
defect
in
swarming
(
Figure
6A
)
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
our
finding
that
flagellar
motor
switching
is
not
critical
for
swarming
.

In
a
final
functional
test
,
individual
cells
of
four
different
strains
-
wild
-
type
cells
and
mutants
with
yhjH
,
cheR
,
and
cheZ
deletions
-
were
tethered
to
a
microscope
slide
and
the
frequency
of
flagellar
rotation
switching
was
measured
using
computer
tracking
software
in
a
fashion
similar
to
Block
et
al
.

[
44
]
.

This
finding
is
consistent
with
the
chi
-
phage
selection
results
.

Tether
assays
with
DeltayhjH
DeltacheZ
double
mutants
showed
flagellar
rotation
indistinguishable
from
cheZ
single
mutants
(
unpublished
data
)
,
indicating
that
null
mutations
in
cheZ
are
epistatic
to
null
mutations
in
yhjH
.

Genome
-
Wide
Identification
of
Genetic
Interactions

The
identification
of
novel
genes
that
influence
the
expression
of
a
phenotype
is
only
the
first
step
towards
understanding
its
genetic
basis
.

We
can
dissect
the
genetic
network
context
in
which
newly
identified
genes
function
by
making
libraries
of
double
mutants
in
which
a
transposon
library
is
constructed
in
the
background
of
a
mutation
of
interest
.

Systematic
analyses
of
such
interactions
in
yeast
[
46
,
47
]
are
providing
a
wealth
of
knowledge
about
gene
function
and
pathway
organization
.

Secondary
insertional
mutations
were
observed
to
suppress
motility
defects
in
Deltahns
and
DeltayhjH
genetic
backgrounds
(
Figures
6C
and
S8A
)
.

Among
the
18
suppressor
mutants
sampled
at
random
from
the
DeltayhjH
background
,
half
had
insertions
in
different
regions
of
ycgR
,
a
gene
encoding
a
protein
of
unknown
function
(
Figure
6D
)
.

This
finding
is
consistent
with
a
recent
report
in
which
the
inactivation
of
ycgR
was
observed
to
improve
motility
of
yhjH
mutants
[
48
]
.

The
other
half
of
DeltayhjH
suppressor
mutations
were
found
to
contain
insertions
within
the
intergenic
region
between
the
divergently
transcribed
genes
yfgF
and
yfgG
,
which
encode
gene
products
of
unknown
function
.

P1

of
this

to
the
DeltayhjH
isogenic
background
confirmed
the
ability
of
the
insertion
to
suppress
the
motility
defect
(
unpublished
data
)
.

However
,
deletions
of
either
yfgF
or
yfgG
produced
no
measurable
difference
in
motility
in
the
DeltayhjH
background
(
Figure
S9
)
.

Conversely
,
overexpression
of
yfgF
(
but
not
yfgG
)
was
found
to
suppress
the
motility
defect
of
DeltayhjH
mutants
(
Figure
6E
)
.

Microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
of
the
entire
pool
of
mutants
extracted
from
the
motile
front
guided
the
identification
of
five
additional
suppressor
mutations
(
Figure
6F
;
Dataset
S11
)
.

Among
the
loci
that
partially
suppress
the
motility
defect
of
DeltayhjH
are
fliZ
(
a
gene
predicted
to
be
a
regulator
of
the
flagellum
-
specific
sigma
factor
sigma28
)
,
yfiR
(
a
gene
identified
in
the
selection
for
swarming
motility
defective
mutants
)
,
and
three
additional
genes
of
unknown
function
:
yjdA
,
yjcZ
,
and
yegE
.

Further
studies
are
underway
to
explore
the
functional
relationship
between
yhjH
and
these
suppressor
mutations
.

The
mechanisms
by
which
deletion
of
yegE
and
overexpression
of
yfgF
suppress
the
motility
defect
of
DeltayhjH
mutants
are
discussed
in
the
next
section
.

Suppressor
mutations
identified
in
the
Deltahns
background
are

The
Role
of
the
C
-
di
-
GMP
Second
-
Messenger
System
in
Swimming
and
Swarming
Motility

Based
on
sequence
homology
,
YhjH
,
YfgF
,
and
YegE
belong
to
the
newly
identified
and
highly
prevalent
family
of
proteins
that
function
in
the
turnover
of
bis
-
(
3
'
-
5
'
)
-
cyclic
dimeric
guanosine
monophosphate
(
c
-
di
-
GMP
)
,
which
is
a
second
messenger
involved
in
the
regulation
of
a
wide
variety
of
bacterial
behaviors
[
49
]
.

Synthesis
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
is
catalyzed
by
diguanylate
cyclases
(
DGC
)
and
its
degradation
is
regulated
by
phosphodiesterases
(
PDE
)
.

YhjH
contains
an
EAL
domain
,
and
expression
of
this
protein
leads
to
the
degradation
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
and
enhanced
motility
in
S
.
enterica
[
52
]
.

YegE
and
YfgF
both
contain
an
EAL
domain
C
-
terminal
to
a
GGDEF
domain
(
Figure
6G
)
.

In
addition
,
several
GGDEF
/
EAL
composite
proteins
were
found
to
exhibit
either
DGC
or
PDE
activity
[
53
,
54
]
.

Based
on
the
known
antagonistic
effects
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
on
motility
[
52
]
and
by
following
several
lines
of
reasoning
,
we
hypothesized
the
dominant
enzymatic
activities
of
the
GGDEF
and
EAL
domains
in
YfgF
and
YegE
.

We
argue
that
YfgF
has
an
active
EAL
domain
and
functions
as
a
PDE
based
on
three
observations
:
(
1
)
expression
of
this
gene
enhances
motility
of
the
DeltayhjH
strain
(
Figure
6E
)
;
(
2
)
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
YfgF
shows
similarity
to
enzymatically
active
EAL
domains
(
Figure
S10
)
;
and
(
3
)
the
amino
acid
sequence
lacks
a
complete
GGDEF
motif
needed
for
DGC
activity
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Based
on
these
observations
,
we
propose
that
deleting
yegE
and
over
-
expressing
yfgF
suppress
the
motility
defect
of
the
DeltayhjH
strain
by
reducing
the
intracellular
levels
of
c
-
di
-
GMP
(
Figure
7
)
.

E
.
coli
has
19
genes
encoding
proteins
with
GGDEF
domains
[
55
]
.

However
,
the
results
of
the
genome
-
wide
screen
for
suppressors
of
the
DeltayhjH
motility
defect
reveals
that
this
is
not
the
case
(
Table
S2
)
.

The
manner
in
which
c
-
di
-
GMP
alters
motility
at
the
molecular
level
is
currently
unknown
.

However
,
it
has
been
reported
that
c
-
di
-
GMP
binds
to
the
PilZ
domain
of
the
aforementioned
YcgR
protein
[
48
]
.

It
is
hypothesized
that
YcgR
undergoes
a
conformational
change
upon
binding
to
c
-
di
-
GMP
,
and
that
the
YcgR
-
c
-
di
-
GMP
complex
impairs
motility
through
a
protein
-
protein
interaction
with
the
flagellar
motor
[
57
]
.

In
addition
to
its
effects
on
swimming
,
we
found
evidence
that
c
-
di
-
GMP
signaling
also
plays
a
role
in
swarming
motility
.

As
stated
previously
,
mutations
in
yfiR
strongly
abolish
swarming
motility
.

YfiR
is
predicted
to
be
a
periplasmic
protein
,
YfiB
shows
sequence
similarity
to
outer
-
membrane
porin
proteins
,
and
YfiN
is
a
predicted
inner
-
membrane
protein
with
GGDEF
and
HAMP
domains
.

The
observations
that
the
DeltayhjH
mutant
is
impaired
in
swimming
but
indistinguishable
from
the
wild
-
type
strain
in
swarming
,
while
in
contrast
the
DeltayfiR
strain
cannot
swarm
and
is
only
mildly
impaired
in
swimming
,
support
the
notion
that
c
-
di
-
GMP
signaling
pathways
are
temporally
and
/
or
spatially
separated
,
as
recently
suggested
by
others
[
58
,
59
]
.

The
abundance
of
fimE
and
fimB
mutants
in
the
enrichment
for
nonmotile
mutants
suggested
a
role
for
type
1
fimbriae
in
swimming
motility
.

By
randomly
sampling
mutants
impaired
for
motility
and
sequencing
the
region
of
DNA
adjacent
to
the
transposon
,
we
identified
a
mutant
with
a
reduced
ability
to
swim
with
an
insertion
within
fimS
.

This
observation
is
confirmed
by
comparing
the
motility
of
the
fimS
mutant
to
phase
ON
fimB
-
fimE
-
double
mutants
(
Figure
S11B
)
.

The
basis
for
motility
suppression
by
constitutive
fimbriae
expression
remains
unclear
;
however
,
we
observed
that
hyper
-
fimbriated
cells
tend
to
have
,
on
average
,
fewer
flagella
compared
to
their
afimbriated
counterparts
(
Figure
S11D
)
.

This
may
reflect
competing
demands
for
resources
and
/
or
surface
area
for
synthesis
and
assembly
of
these
extracellular
appendages
.

Some
of
these
environmental
influences
may
be
due
to
direct
physicochemical
perturbations
to
chemotaxis
or
flagellar
function
.

We
reasoned
that
null
mutations
in
components
of
such
upstream
signaling
pathways
would
alleviate
repression
of
chemotaxis
under
high
[
NaCl
]
conditions
.

As
can
be
seen
in
Figure
S12A
,
this
is
in
fact
what
we
observe
since
,
during
the
same
time
interval
,
some
members
from
the
transposon
mutant
library
travel
significantly
further
away
from
the
site
of
inoculation
than
do
the
homogeneous
population
of
wild
-
type
cells
.

Microarray
-
based
genetic
footprinting
of
these
mutants
provided
quantitative
genome
-
wide
readout
of
the
population
(
Dataset
S13
)
.

The
selection
results
revealed
that
mutants
harboring
insertions
in
five
genes
(
ompR
,
envZ
,
znuA
,
znuC
,
and
yfiM
)
were
the
most
abundant
.

The
microarray
results
were
confirmed
by
showing
that
individual
strains
with
mutations
in
these
genes
showed
increased
motility
in
high
[
NaCl
]
relative
to
the
wild
-
type
strain
(
Figure
S12B
)
.

EnvZ
is
the
sensor
kinase
that
phosphorylates
OmpR
,
a
DNA
-
binding
regulatory
protein
,
under
conditions
of
high
osmolarity
[

]
.

ZnuA
and
ZnuC
are
part
of
a
high
-
affinity
zinc
uptake
system
.

Conclusions
and
Summary

Microbes
account
for
half
the
world
'
s
biomass
and
are
the
most
widely
distributed
organisms
on
the
planet
.

Yet
most
of
our
genetic
understanding
of
bacterial
behavior
comes
from
the
tiny
fraction
of
microbes
studied
in
the
laboratory
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
established
a
powerful
framework
for
the
efficient
and
comprehensive
identification
of
the
genetic
basis
of
complex
bacterial
behaviors
.

The
power
of
this
approach
lies
in
the
rapid
and
parallel
manner
in
which
positive
and
negative
genetic
contributions
can
be
mapped
to
any
phenotype
after
competitive
selection
.

In
this
study
,
we
confirmed
our
findings
by
functional
analyses
of
individual
mutants
,
which
revealed
high
levels
of
sensitivity
and
low
rates
of
false
positives
.

In
addition
,
we
have
shown
that
the
same
method
can
be
used
to
quickly
and
thoroughly
explore
the
genetic
interactions
between
a
single
locus
and
all
other
genetic
loci
in
the
genome
.

These
interactions
correspond
to
important
network
-
level
concepts
;
for
example
,
the
flow
of
information
within
signal
transduction
pathways
and
second
-
messenger
systems
such
as
c
-
di
-
GMP
.

Enterococci
have
emerged
over
the
past
few
decades
as
the
second
to
third
most
common
cause
of
nosocomial
infections
,
including
urinary
tract
and
soft
tissue
infections
,
bacteremia
,
and
endocarditis
[
1
-
3
]
.

Entecococcal
infections
are
predominantly
caused
by
E
.
faecalis
and
E
.
faecium
.

To
differentiate
the
two
faces
of
this
organism
,
genome
-
wide
comparisons
are
necessary
.

Although
hundreds
of
microbial
genomes
have
been
sequenced
,
only
two
E
.
faecalis
genomes
have
been
reported
(
V583
as
a
clinical
isolate
[
4
]
and
Symbioflor
1
as
a
commensal
isolate
[
5
]
)
,
but
only
the
V583
genome
has
been
made
publicly
available
.

OG1RF
is
a
rifampicin
and
fusidic
acid
resistant
derivative
of
OG1
[
8
,
9
]
.

Multilocus
sequence
typing
(
MLST
)
showed
that
OG1RF
is
clonally
distinct
from
V583
(
differs
in
six
out
of
seven
alleles
of
housekeeping
genes
)
[
11
]
and
characterization
of
regions
flanking
transposon
insertions
in
OG1RF
suggested
that
approximately
10
%
of
their
sequences
differed
[
12
]
.

OG1
and
its
derivatives
have
been
successfully
used
over
the
past
20
years
in
various
animal
models
,
starting
with
the
demonstration
that
it
can
cause
caries
in
germ
-
free
rats
[
7
]
,
and
later
to
characterize
factors
important
for
E
.
faecalis
virulence
in
a
mouse
model
of
peritonitis
[
13
]
,
a
rabbit
model
of
endophthalmitis
[
14
]
,
a
rat
model
of
endocarditis
[
15
]
and
in
a
mouse
urinary
tract
infection
model
[
16
]
.

OG1RF
was
also
shown
to
be
as
virulent
as
V583
in
the
model
host
Caenorhabditis
elegans
[
17
]
.

Numerous
factors
important
for
virulence
have
been
characterized
in
OG1RF
.

A
recently
described
example
are
the
Ebp
pili
,
whose
subunits
are
encoded
by
the
ebp
operon
[
18
]
and
whose
genes
are
regulated
by
EbpR
[
19
]
.

Also
present
is
Ace
,
a
member
of
the
MSCRAMM
(
microbial
surface
component
recognizing
adhesive
matrix
molecules
)
family
.

Thus
,
we
analyzed
the
sequence
of
E
.
faecalis
OG1RF
.

The
unique
regions
were
then
characterized
further
.

General
genome
features
The
complete
circular
chromosome
of
OG1RF
was
found
to
be
2
,
739
,
625
bp
with
an
average
G
+
C
content
of
37
.
8
%
.

[

]
showed
only
minor
variations
(
primarily
an
overestimation
of
30
kb
for
the
Sfi
I
fragment
E
,
540
kb
versus
509
kb
predicted
from
the
sequence
;
Figure
1
)
.

The
10
missing
tRNA
are
localized
in
a
region
in
V583
that
has
been
replaced
in
OG1RF
by
a
49
kb
region
(
see
below
)
.

Some
of
the
major
insertions
/
deletions
in
the
two
genomes
are
shown
in
Figure
2
,
such
as
the
absence
of
the
pathogenicity
island
(
PAI
)
in
OG1RF
and
the
presence
of
an
approximately
49
kb
fragment
unique
to
OG1RF
.

Overall
,
we
found
64
areas
of
divergence
between
the
genomes
that
can
be
divided
into
3
classes
:
an
additional
sequence
present
in
OG1RF
when
compared
with
V583
;
a
sequence
replacement
where
a
sequence
in
OG1RF
differs
from
the
sequence
in
V583
;
and
the
absence
of
a
sequence
from
OG1RF
when
compared
with
V583
.

Both
OG1RF
CRISPR
elements
are
composed
of
7
repeats
of
a
37
bp
palindromic
sequence
with
a
29
bp
spacer
.

The
CRISPR1
-
associated
proteins
belong
to
the
Nmeni
subtype
[
28
]
.

The
four
cas
genes
encode
Cas

(

,
Cas2
(

,
and
Cas

.

To
determine
the
distribution
of
the
CRISPR1
locus
in
E
.
faecalis
strains
,
16
isolates
of
various
MLST
types
were
tested
for
the
presence
(
PCR
with
primers
specific
for
csn1
and
cas1
)
or
absence
(
PCR
with
primers
overlapping
the
junction
between

and

)
of
the
CRISPR1
locus

these

carry

In
a
more
recent

of

between

of

A
hypothesis
that
the
number
of
repeats
may
be
proportional
to
the
depth
of
the
peptidoglycan
has
been
proposed
[

.

Another
family
of
E

faecalis
surface
proteins
includes
the
newly
described
WxL
domain
surface
proteins
.

Siezen

reported
a
novel
gene
cluster
encoding
exclusively
cell
-
surface
proteins
that
is
conserved
in
a
subgroup
of
Gram
-
positive
bacteria
.

Each
gene
cluster
has
at
least
one
member
of
three
gene
families
:
a
gene
encoding
a
small
LPxTG
protein
(
approximately
120
amino
acids
)
;
a
gene
encoding
a
member
of
the
DUF916
transmembrane
protein
family
;
and
a
gene
encoding
a
WxL
domain
surface
protein
.

OG1RF
does
not
contain
homologues
of
EF2248
-

(
carrying
instead
the
iol
operon
)
,
though
it
has
a
novel
WxL

within
the

unique
region
upstream
of
the

[

,
other

,
including
the
EF3153

,
were
not
detected

In
addition
,
it
appears
that
the
EF3248
locus
diverges
in
the
Symbioflor

strain
.

When
compared
to
V583
,
the
sequence

in
this

between
the
two

appears
to
be
as
low
as
75

)
.

However
,
because
the
Symbioflor
1
genome
sequence
is
not
currently
available
,
it
was
not
possible
to
compare
their
respective
sequences
in
more
detail
.

Since
these
proteins
are
located
at
the
surface
of
the
cell
,
the
low
level
of
homology
shared
between
them
may
be
the
result
of
antigenic
variation
.

In
OG1RF
,
the
region
that
would
encode
the
cps
operon
is
only
59
bp
in
length
and
has
no
homology
with
V583
.

Thus
,
while
V583
and
OG1RF
share
much
similarity
between
their
surface
components
,
there
are
unique
differences
that
could
potentially
be
important
in
affecting
the
behavior
of
the
strains
and
might
be
useful
for
strain
typing
.

Two
-
component
regulatory
systems

OG1RF
lacks
four
two
-
component
systems
found
in
V583
.

These
are
histidine
kinase
-
response
regulator
(
HK
-
RR
)
08
,
HK
-
RR12
located
in
the
PAI
,
HK
-
RR16
and
the
vanB
regulatory
system
HK
-
RR11
[

]
.

OG1RF
_
0193
shares
82
%
similarity
with
VanRG
and
81
%
similarity
with
VanRG2
.

A
gene
(
OG1RF
_
0191
)
encoding
an
M15
family
muramoyl
pentapeptide
carboxypeptidase
is
located
downstream
of
these
two
-
component
regulatory
genes
(
Figure
4a
)
.

The
predicted
carboxypeptidase
(
OG1RF
_
0191
)
shares
69
%
similarity
over
179
amino
acids
with
EF2297
,
a
membrane
-
associated
D
,
D
-
carboxypeptidase
encoded
by
the
vanB
operon
in
V583
.

The
iol
operon

OG1RF
carries
an
iol
operon
while
V583
does
not
.

This
operon
encodes
the
factors
necessary
for
the
degradation
of
myo
-
inositol
into
glyceraldehyde
-
3P
.

Many
soil
and
plant
micro
-
organisms
,
including
Bacillus
subtilis
[
41
]
(
first
iol
operon
identified
)
,
Klebsiella
spp
.

The
OG1RF
iol
operon
appears
to
be
closely
related
to
ones
described
in
Clostridium
perfringens
[
44
]
and
Lactobacillus
casei
[
45
]
.

In
L
.
casei
,
the
myo
-
inositol
operon
consists
of
ten
genes
with
an
upstream
divergent
regulator
gene
,
iolR
.

To
investigate
whether
the
iol
operon
was
'
inserted
into
'
or
'
removed
from
'
a
putative
ancestral
strain
,
the
sequences
surrounding
the
iol
genes
were
examined
.

The
possible
junction
and
presence
of
unique
sequence
in
this
region
,
if
investigated
,
was
not
mentioned
in
the
publication
.

Nonetheless
,
preliminary
analysis
of
other
strains
'
genotypes
in
this
area
seemed
to
confirm
the
hypothesis
of
a
hot
region
for
rearrangement
(
data
not
shown
)
.

An
analysis
of
the
G
+
C
content
of
OG1RF
unique
regions
revealed
several
loci
with
a
lower
G
+
C
content
than
the
37
.
8
%
average
content
of
OG1RF
.

This
fragment
appears
to
be
a
patchwork
composed
of
hypothetical
genes
,
homologues
of
Tn916
-
associated
genes
and
homologues
of
genes
from
other
Gram
-
positive
organisms
,
including
Listeria
,
E
.
faecium
,
staphylococci
,
or
lactococci
(
Additional

)
.

However
,
the
approximately
49
kb
fragment
lacks
an
excisase
gene
and
the
probable
lantibiotic
ABC
transporter
genes
present
in
Tn5386
.

An
uninterrupted
competence
operon
in
OG1RF

OG1RF
contains
what
appears
to
be
an
intact
competence
operon
while
that
of
V583
appears
to
be
non
-
functional
.

For
example
,
the
homologue
in
OG1RF
of
EF2046
shares
61
%
similarity
with
ComYA
and
the
OG1RF
homologue
of
EF2045
is
55
%
similar
to
ComYB
.

In
V583
,
the
fourth
gene
of
this
operon
(
corresponding
to
OG1RF
_
0148
)
is
interrupted
by
phage
4
(
EF1896
-
EF2043
)
;
in
addition
,
EF1984
contains
a
premature
stop
codon
not
found
in
the
corresponding
gene
in
OG1RF
(
OG1RF
_
0228
)
.

Natural
competence
has
not
been
reported
for
E
.
faecalis
.

We
have
also
noted
that
V583
is
less
transformable
by
electroporation
than
OG1RF
.

To
investigate
the
possibility
that
directly
or
indirectly
the
com
operon
might
be
responsible
for
this
phenotype
,
we
also
evaluated
transformability
by
electroporation
.

When
compared
with
OG1RF
,
transposon
mutants
[
12
]
in
the
OG1RF
equivalent
of
EF2045
(
encoding
the
comGB
homologue
)
and
in
the
OG1RF
equivalent
of
EF1986
(
encoding
the
comGF
homologue
)
showed
similar
levels
of
transformability
by
electroporation
(
data
not
shown
)
,
implying
that
the
difference
in
electroporation
efficiency
observed
between
OG1RF
and
V583
is
not
related
to
this
locus
.

The
other
ComDE
homology
is
that
with
a
two
-
component
system
unique
to
OG1RF
(
OG1RF
_
0199
and
OG1RF
_
0198
,
respectively
)
that
lies
on
a
4
,
706
bp
unique
fragment
that
maps
between
EF3114
and
EF3115
in
V583
.

This
fragment
also
carries
two
genes
(
OG1RF
_
0200
and
OG1RF
_
0201
)
encoding
homologues
of
the
YhaQ
and
YhaP
sodium
efflux
ATP
-
binding
cassette
efflux
/
transporter
proteins
(
Figure
4b
)
.

Although
they
are
potential
elements
of
a
secretion
apparatus
,
these
two
proteins
do
not
share
any
homology
at
the
protein
level
with
the
competence
secretion
apparatus
ComAB
of
S
.
pneumoniae
[
51
]
nor
CslAB
from
S
.
mutans
[
52
]
.

Searching
for
a
possible
CSP
in
the
vicinity
of
these
genes
,
we
identified
a
small
ORF
encoding
50
amino
acids
between
yhaP
and
OG1RF199
and
another
encoding
20
amino
acids
downstream
of
OG1RF198
.

More
analysis
will
be
required
to
determine
if
there
are
conditions
in
which
the
OG1RF
com
operon
is
expressed
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
two
-
component
system
is
involved
in
competence
.

Limited
presence
of
mobile
elements

By
probing
a
microarray
of
the
V583
genome
and
plasmids
with
OG1RF
genomic
DNA
,
we
previously
estimated
that
only
75
%
of
V583
ORFs
were
also
present
in
OG1RF
[
22
]
.

[
53
]
compared
nine
strains
,
including
OG1RF
to
V583
,
using
comparative
genomic
hybridization
.

In
these
results
,
OG1RF
appears
to
carry
a
few
genes
included
in
the
PAI
,
and
a
few
prophage
genes
.

The
mutation
leading
to
rifampicin
resistance
was
identified
in
the
rpoB
gene
by
Ozawa
et
al
.

The
mutation
also
affected
the
clumping
phenotype
of
traA
mutants
and
this
effect
appears
to
be
specific
for
the
pAM373
system
[
54
]
.

All
of
the
other
22
differences
in
rpoB
between
OG1RF
and
V583
are
synonymous
.

Fusidic
acid
resistance
is
associated
with
mutation
(
s
)
in
the
fusA
gene
,
which
encodes
elongation
factor
G
.

We
compared
fusA
from
OG1RF
with
that
in
V583
and
identified
two
differences
(
C1368A
and
T1992C
)
.

Mutations
in
this
region
have
been
associated
with
fusidic
acid
resistance
in
Staphylococcus
aureus
[
55
,
56
]
,
and
thus
the
C1368A
mutation
is
likely
the
cause
of
the
fusidic
acid
resistance
phenotype
in
OG1RF
.

Virulence
and
biofilm
comparisons
of
OG1RF
with
V583

When
compared
in
the
mouse
peritonitis
model
,
the
LD50
values
of
V583
in
different
determinations
were
lower
(

However
,
at

showed
more

In

Conclusion

E
.
faecalis
OG1RF
carries
a
number
of
unique
loci
compared
to
V583
.

[
36
]
demonstrate
that
these
factors
may
be
present
in
harmless
strains
while
absent
in
clinical
isolates
,
indicating
that
E
.
faecalis
virulence
is
not
dependent
on
any
single
virulence
factor
.

It
may
be
that
these
clonal
complexes
are
not
more
virulent
per
se
,
as
defined
in
the
assays
described
here
,
but
rather
are
better
able
to
survive
and
/
or
colonize
hospitalized
patients
,
taking
advantage
of
factors
that
predispose
to
nosocomial
infections
such
as
urinary
or
venous
catheters
,
or
mucositis
,
among
others
.

A
Naturally
Occurring
Mutation
in
ropB
Suppresses
SpeB
Expression
and
Reduces
M1T1
Group
A
Streptococcal
Systemic
Virulence

However
,
the
role
of
SpeB
in
the
course
of
infection
is
still
unclear
.

In
this
study
we
utilize
a
SpeB
-
negative
M1T1
clinical
isolate
,
5628
,
with
a
naturally
occurring
mutation
in
the
gene
encoding
the
regulator
RopB
,
to
elucidate
the
role
of
RopB
and
SpeB
in
systemic
virulence
.

Allelic
exchange
mutagenesis
was
used
to
replace
the
mutated
ropB
allele
in
5628
with
the
intact
allele
from
the
well
characterized
isolate
5448
.

The
inverse
allelic
exchange
was
also
performed
to
replace
the
intact
ropB
in
5448
with
the
mutated
allele
from
5628
.

An
intact
ropB
was
found
to
be
essential
for
SpeB
expression
.

These
data
show
that
an
intact
RopB
and
efficient
SpeB
production
are
necessary
for
systemic
infection
with
GAS
.

Streptococcus
pyogenes
(
group
A
streptococcus
;
GAS
)
is
a
Gram
-
positive
,
human
-
specific
pathogen
responsible
for
over
500
,
000
deaths
each
year
[
1
]
.

Severe
invasive
GAS
infections
such
as
necrotizing
fasciitis
account
for
approximately
30
%
of
these
deaths
,
and
the
incidence
of
such
acute
conditions
has
been
on
the
rise
since
the
mid
1980
'
s
[
2
]
.

While
the
M1T1
GAS
has
become
the
most
common
cause
of
streptococcal
pharyngitis
,
this
clone
is
also
overrepresented
in
cases
of
severe
invasive
disease
[
6
]
,
[
7
]
.

Studies
of
M1T1
clinical
isolates
from
invasive
disease
cases
have
revealed
an
inverse
relationship
between
expression
of
the
extracellular
cysteine
protease
SpeB
and
clinical
severity
[
8
]
.

SpeB
is
a
secreted
cysteine
protease
initially
expressed
as
40
kDa
zymogen
which
is
then
converted
to
the
28
kDa
active
form
by
autocatalytic
processing
[
10
]
.

SpeB
is
known
to
cleave
numerous
host
proteins
including
components
of
the
extracellular
matrix
,
cytokine
precursors
,
immunoglobulins
and
antimicrobial
peptides
[
11
]
-
[
13
]
,
which
could
interfere
with
host
immune
functions
.

However
,
SpeB
has
also
been
shown
to
cleave
a
range
of
GAS
proteins
such
as
the
fibrinogen
-
binding
M1
protein
[
14
]
,
[
15
]
,
various
superantigens
[
16
]
,
[
17
]
,
the
secreted
plasminogen
activator
streptokinase
[
18
]
as
well
as
the
DNase
Sda1
[
17
]
,
and
thus
possibly
interfere
with
the
proven
virulence
functions
of
these
bacterial
factors
.

The
precise
role
(
s
)
of
SpeB
throughout
the
course
of
infection
are
undoubtedly
complex
,
and
not
surprisingly
,
different
studies
using
different
in
vivo
animal
models
have
produced
seemingly
contradictory
results
[
19
]
-
[
21
]
.

RopB
is
a
GAS
transcriptional
regulator
that
has
been
shown
to
be
essential
for
expression
of
SpeB
and
binds
directly
to
the
promoter
region
of
speB
[
23
]
,
[
24
]
.

In
studies
performed
in
different
GAS
serotype
strains
,
RopB
has
variably
been
suggested
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
other
GAS
genes
including
those
associated
with
metabolism
of
non
-
glucose
carbohydrates
and
amino
acids
[
25
]
,
[
26
]
,
response
to
thermal
and
oxidative
stress
[
25
]
,
[
27
]
and
the
expression
of
virulence
factors
including
DNases
(
MF
-
1
and
MF
-
3
)
and
hemolysins
(
streptolysin
S
and
streptolysin
O
)
[
26
]
,
[
28
]
,
[
29
]
.

For
example
,
separate
studies
have
shown
ropB
mutation
to
have
either
no
effect
on
hemolysis
and
DNase
activity
or
,
alternatively
,
to
increase
expression
of
hemolysin
and
DNase
-
encoding
genes
and
the
associated
phenotypic
activities
[
23
]
,
[
26
]
.

This
strain
-
specific
variation
is
highlighted
in
a
recent
work
by
Dmitriev
et
al
.

This
analysis
begins
with
a
naturally
-
occuring
mutation
in
ropB
identified
in
one
such
strain
.

Sequence
analysis
of
clinical
isolate
5628
reveals
intact
speB
and
covR
/
S
but
mutation
in
ropB
M1T1
GAS
clinical
isolate
5628
was
found
on
screening
to
lack
SpeB
activity
by
azocasein
assay
.

DNA
sequencing
was
performed
using
primers
listed
in
Table
1
.

The
truncation
of
RopB
suggested
that
this
may
be
the
cause
of
lack
of
SpeB
expression
in
this
strain
.

Western
blot
detected
SpeB
in
overnight
culture
supernatants
of
5628R
+
,
containing
the
intact
ropB
allele
,
but
not
in
the
clinical
isolate
5628
nor
the
isogenic
mutant
5628RDeltaSpeB
,
containing
the
intact
ropB
allele
but
lacking
speB
(
Fig
.
1B
)
.

These
data
demonstrated
that
the
ropB
point
mutation
was
indeed
responsible
for
the
lack
of
SpeB
expression
in
the
clinical
isolate
5628
.

RopB
mutation
does
not
affect
bacterial
growth
,
hemolysis
,
DNase
activity
or
resistance
to
neutrophil
killing

GAS
strain
5628
and
its
isogenic
mutants
5628R
+
and
5628RDeltaSpeB
were
grown
in
THB
,
and
the
OD600
was
measured
over
time
.

No
significant
difference
was
found
among
the
growth
rates
of
the
three
bacterial
strains
(
Fig
.
2A
)
.

No
significant
difference
was
seen
in
hemolytic
activity
among
strains
containing
the
WT
or
mutated
ropB
allele
(
Fig
.
2B
)
.

Extracellular
DNase
activity
of
mid
-
log
phase
bacteria
and
GAS
resistance
to
neutrophil
killing
were
also
unaffected
by
mutation
in
ropB
(
Fig
.
2C
and
2D
)
.

Three
days
post
-
infection
,
bacteria
were
recovered
from
the
lesion
and
screened
for
SpeB
status
using
the
skim
-
milk
agar
method
.

This
finding
reveals
that
when
SpeB
-
negative
colonies
are
selected
for
in
vivo
,
this
selection
is
predominantly
a
phenomenon
associated
with
CovR
/
S
inactivation
.

SpeB
is
the
principal
target
of
RopB
regulation
in
vivo

Microarray
analysis
was
performed
on
in
vivo
-
derived
RNA
from
the
well
characterized
GAS
strain
5448
and
its
derivative
5448R
-
,
containing
the
mutated
ropB
allele
from
5628
.

Fourty
-
seven
genes
were
found
to
be
down
-
regulated
and
52
genes
were
found
to
be
up
-
regulated
in
5448R
-
greater
than
2
-
fold
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
.

In
addition
to
the
SpeB
operon
,
genes
of
the
streptolysin
S
operon
were
also
found
to
be
strongly
down
-
regulated
in
the
ropB
mutant
strain
.

Apart
from
the
gene
encoding
the
superantigen
SmeZ
,
there
was
an
absence
of
virulence
-
related
genes
found
to
be
strongly
up
-
regulated
in
the
strain
5448R
-
,
which
expressed
the
truncated
RopB
.

GAS
strain
5628R
+
expressing
a
full
length
RopB
showed
increased
virulence
compared
to
the
strain
5628
with
a
truncated
RopB
(
Figure
4A
)
.

Strain
5628RDeltaSpeB
containing
a
full
-
length
RopB
but
lacking
SpeB
also
showed
reduced
virulence
,
suggesting
that
the
reduced
virulence
of
5628
may
primarily
result
from
the
lack
of
SpeB
expression
in
this
strain
.

Virulence
was
also
examined
in
an
intravenous
model
of
systemic
infection
.

The
well
characterized
strain
5448
and
its
isogenic
mutant
5448R
-
,
containing
the
ropB
allele
from
5628
,
were
further
included
to
examine
the
effect
of
this
allelic
variation
in
a
well
-
characterized
virulent
strain
of
GAS
.

Discussion

In
the
globally
-
disseminated
clonal
M1T1
serotype
associated
with
epidemic
invasive
GAS
infection
,
an
inverse
relationship
has
been
found
between
SpeB
activity
and
clinical
disease
severity
[
8
]
.

Recently
,
we
and
others
have
found
a
connection
between
inactivation
of
SpeB
through
mutation
in
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
covR
/
S
and
development
of
invasive
disease
in
the
murine
model
[
37
]
,
[
38
]
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
investigated
a
second
mechanism
of
inactivation
of
SpeB
,
namely
through
truncation
of
the
regulator
RopB
.

We
have
shown
that
in
M1T1
GAS
,
when
the
covR
/
S
locus
is
intact
and
DNase
Sda1
activity
is
unaffected
,
ropB
point
mutation
results
in
reduced
virulence
in
vivo
,
despite
inactivation
of
SpeB
activity
.

The
SpeB
-
negative
,
serotype
M1T1
clinical
isolate
5628
was
used
to
investigate
the
role
of
RopB
in
virulence
.

The
M1T1
strain
5628
contains
a
point
mutation
in
the
ropB
gene
that
results
in
a
truncation
of
the
last
110
amino
acids
of
the
280
amino
acid
protein
.

RopB
mutation
in
this
particular
strain
does
not
result
in
the
kind
of
global
phenotypic
change
found
with
covR
/
S
mutation
where
differential
expression
was
observed
of
multiple
genes
encoding
virulence
determinants
,
including
sic
,
ska
,
slo
,
speA
,
speJ
,
scpC
and
the
hyaluronic
acid
synthesis
operon
[
37
]
which
were
all
unaffected
in
the
ropB
mutant
examined
in
this
work
.

Recently
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
WT
,
SpeB
-
positive
bacteria
undergo
a
phase
-
shift
to
a
SpeB
-
negative
phenotype
after
subcutaneous
infection
of
mice
[
17
]
.

Of
the
down
-
regulated
genes
in
CovR
/
S
mutant
strains
,
SpeB
would
appear
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
due
to
its
ability
to
degrade
many
host
and
self
-
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
the
switch
to
a
SpeB
-
negative
phenotype
appeared
to
occur
exclusively
through
mutations
in
covR
/
S
.

This
result
suggests
that
covR
/
S
mutations
are
the
predominant
method
of
phenotypic
switching
in
GAS
and
that
ropB
mutation
is
not
readily
selected
for
in
vivo
.

This
finding
supported
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
data
that
suggested
SpeB
is
the
main
target
of
RopB
regulation
in
this
strain
.

Virulence
studies
utilizing
systemic
models
of
infection
showed
that
a
full
-
length
RopB
was
required
for
virulence
.

These
data
illustrate
the
necessity
for
an
intact
RopB
for
full
virulence
in
vivo
.

In
addition
,
the
strain
5628RDeltaSpeB
expressing
an
intact
RopB
but
lacking
SpeB
showed
similarly
reduced
virulence
to
the
strain
with
a
truncated
RopB
.

Of
note
,
the
additional
virulence
factors
streptokinase
and
M1
protein
,
are
both
up
-
regulated
in
covR
/
S
mutant
M1T1
strains
[
37
]
,
but
not
in
the
ropB
mutant
under
investigation
in
this
study
.

Streptokinase
and
M1
protein
are
believed
to
play
a
role
in
the
accumulation
of
host
plasmin
at
the
GAS
cell
surface
,
a
process
which
is
thought
to
accentuate
invasive
disease
[
5
]
,
[
42
]
,
[
43
]
.

In
M1T1
GAS
,
an
intact
RopB
and
efficient
SpeB
production
are
necessary
for
systemic
infection
.

A
mutation
in
any
one
of
these
three
genes
,
csrA
,
hfq
,
and
smpB
,
in
Salmonella
is
attenuated
for
mouse
virulence
and
unable
to
survive
in
macrophages
.

CsrA
has
a
clearly
defined
specificity
based
on
binding
to
a
specific
mRNA
sequence
to
inhibit
translation
.

However
,
the
proteins
regulated
by
Hfq
and
SmpB
are
not
as
clearly
defined
.

In
this
report
we
have
used
global
proteomics
to
directly
identify
proteins
regulated
by
Hfq
or
SmpB
by
comparing
protein
abundance
in
the
parent
and
isogenic
hfq
or
smpB
mutant
.

From
these
same
samples
we
also
prepared
RNA
for
microarray
analysis
to
determine
if
alteration
of
protein
expression
was
mediated
post
-
transcriptionally
.

These
proteins
represent
a
broad
spectrum
of
Salmonella
proteins
required
for
many
biological
processes
including
host
cell
invasion
,
motility
,
central
metabolism
,
LPS
biosynthesis
,
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
,
and
fatty
acid
metabolism
.

Our
results
represent
one
of
the
first
global
analyses
of
post
-
transcriptional
regulons
in
any
organism
and
suggest
that
regulation
at
the
translational
level
is
widespread
and
plays
an
important
role
in
virulence
regulation
and
environmental
adaptation
for
Salmonella
.

Introduction

tmRNA
functions
as
a
part
of
the
translational
quality
control
process
,
recognizing
and
binding
to
ribosomes
that
become
stalled
.

Usually
classified
as
a
housekeeping
or
repair
system
,
a
role
for
tmRNA
as
a
regulatory
sRNA
has
been
recently
suggested
.

Ranquet
and
Gottesman
[
19
]
report
that
the
sRNA
tmRNA
plays
a
regulatory
role
in
gene
expression
and
is
required
for
the
correct
high
-
level
translation
of
RpoS
.

Recent
reports
suggest
that
both
Hfq
and
SmpB
play
essential
roles
in
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

In
another
study
,
a
smpB
mutant
of
Salmonella
Typhimurium
exhibited
defects
in
intra
-
macrophage
survival
,
a
model
of
Salmonella
pathogenesis
[
23
]
.

More
recently
mutation
of
tmRNA
was
shown
to
be
responsible
for
a
marked
reduction
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
virulence
in
BALB
/
c
mice
[
24
]
.

Identifying
what
proteins
are
actually
regulated
by
Hfq
and
SmpB
is
an
important
step
in
understanding
the
impact
of
post
-
transcriptional
gene
regulation
in
Enterobacteria
and
more
specifically
how
Hfq
and
SmpB
control
Salmonella
gene
expression
at
the
post
-
transcriptional
/
translational
level
and
the
role
that
this
may
play
in
Salmonella
pathogenesis
.

Zhang
et
al
.

In
a
recent
study
Sittka
et
al
.

[
10
]
used
high
-
throughput
pyrosequencing
(
HTPS
)
to
detect
potential
targets
of
an
epitope
tagged
-
Hfq
protein
co
-
immunoprecipitated
with
commercially
available
antibodies
,
overcoming
the
limitations
of
the
previous
strategy
;
the
need
for
custom
microarrays
and
specialized
antibodies
.

In
another
study
[
27
]
microarray
analysis
was
used
to
identify
changes
in
gene
expression
resulting
from
lack
of
Hfq
,
thus
providing
potential
new
target
genes
for
sRNA
regulation
.

In
addition
,
it
is
clear
that
a
transcriptional
analysis
solely
can
not
distinguish
between
transcriptional
and
translational
/
post
-
transcriptional
regulatory
effects
.

Here
,
we
performed
sample
-
matched
global
proteomics
and
transcriptional
analyses
together
with
cellular
assays
and
animal
studies
to
begin
to
understand
how
Hfq
and
SmpB
control
Salmonella
gene
expression
at
the
post
-
transcriptional
level
and
the
role
that
this
may
play
in
Salmonella
pathogenesis
.

The
extent
of
global
regulation
of
translation
is
much
greater
than
previously
thought
[
10
]
,
with
profound
effects
in
all
stages
of
Salmonella
'
s
life
cycle
including
a
variety
of
house
keeping
pathways
and
known
and
novel
virulence
factors
,
in
part
explaining
the
requirement
of
both
translational
regulators
for
virulence
in
Salmonella
.

This
study
represents
one
of
the
first
comparative
global
analyses
of
post
-
transcriptional
regulation
in
any
organism
;
the
data
suggest
post
-
transcriptional
regulation
is
widespread
and
plays
an
important
role
in
virulence
regulation
and
environmental
adaptation
for
Salmonella
.

In
this
method
[
28
]
,
the
coding
region
between
the
initiation
methionine
and
the
last
seven
amino
acids
of
the
gene
was
replaced
with
an
inframe
"
scar
"
sequence
that
does
not
contain
any
stop
codons
.

Functional
disruption
of
the
hfq
and
smpB
mutant
derivatives
was
first
confirmed
by
PCR
analysis
after
which
the
mutants
were
P22
transduced
to
a
new
genetic
background
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
secondary
mutations
.

Mutants
that
lacked
either
of
these
proteins
showed
impaired
growth
phenotype
in
acidic
minimal
media
(
AMM
)
.

These
results
suggest
SmpB
and
Hfq
are
involved
in
broad
cellular
functions
,
including
growth
rate
regulation
.

To
directly
assess
the
role
of
Hfq
and
SmpB
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
pathogenesis
,
BALB
/
c
mice
were
infected
intraperitoneally
with
200
cfu
of
either
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
,
DeltasmpB
mutant
strain
or
wildtype
strain
and
monitored
for
21
days
(
Figure
1
)
.

Mice
infected
with
wildtype
strain
exhibited
typical
symptoms
of
infection
and
died
at
around
six
days
.

These
results
are
similar
to
those
in
previous
reports
[
20
]
,
[
23
]
.

Intracellular
survival
/
replication
results
(
Figure
2
)
are
consistent
with
earlier
reports
that
suggest
Deltahfq
and
DeltasmpB
Salmonella
Typhimurium
mutant
strains
are
essential
for
intra
-
macrophage
proliferation
[
22
]
,
[
23
]
,
[
25
]
.

The
differences
in
protein
expression
between
parent
and
isogenic
mutant
was
assessed
via
hypothesis
testing
,
specifically
a
comprehensive
ANOVA
scheme
included
in
the
computer
program
DAnTE
[
30
]
.

When
compared
to
the
entire
Salmonella
proteome
of
4450
annotated
open
reading
frames
(
orf
;
[
31
]
)
,
781
proteins
represents
approximately20
%
of
the
entire
Salmonella
genome
.

This
is
in
agreement
with
a
recent
study
that
found
that
Hfq
affects
18
%
of
the
Salmonella
genome
[
10
]
.

That
is
,
not
every
deregulated
protein
in
the
hfq
mutant
strain
is
necessarily
directly
regulated
by
Hfq
.

We
report
that
Hfq
directly
or
indirectly
modulates
approximately20
%
of
the
Salmonella
genome
.

However
this
most
likely
is
an
underestimate
of
the
true
number
of
proteins
that
are
regulated
by
Hfq
,
if
accurate
protein
identifications
could
be
made
for
the
remaining
2829
orfs
of
the
entire
Salmonella
proteome
(
4450
orfs
)
that
are
either
expressed
at
levels
too
low
to
be
detected
or
not
expressed
under
the
four
growth
conditions
employed
in
this
study
.

Considering
that
we
observe
36
%
(
1621
orfs
)
of
the
entire
Salmonella
proteome
(
4450
orfs
)
and
that
50
%
(
781
orfs
)
of
this
observed
proteome
(
1621
orfs
)
is
modulated
by
Hfq
,
it
would
be
expected
that
a
significant
portion
of
the
unobserved
Salmonella
proteome
(
2829
orfs
)
would
also
be
regulated
by
Hfq
,
thus
our
assertion
that
the
approximately20
%
value
may
very
well
represent
an
underestimation
.

Craig
Venter
Institute
(
JCVI
)
functional
categories
[
32
]
showed
that
Hfq
modulated
the
expression
of
>
/
=
40
%
of
the
observed
proteins
in
15
of
the
19
functional
categories
annotated
for
Salmonella
(
Table
1
)
.

This
category
encompasses
sub
-
categories
including
adaptations
to
atypical
conditions
,
cell
adhesion
,
pathogenesis
,
chemotaxis
and
motility
,
detoxification
,
toxin
production
and
resistance
,
DNA
transformation
and
cell
division
.

[
20
]
investigated
the
proteome
of
an
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
using
2D
gel
analysis
,
and
found
approximately70
differentially
expressed
proteins
in
early
stationary
phase
.

[
20
]
and
hence
one
would
expect
minimal
variability
in
a
cross
-
comparison
between
both
studies
under
these
two
growth
conditions
.

The
exception
was
the
SPI
-
1
protein
SipA
under
LB
Stat
growth
conditions
.

However
under
SPI
-
1
inducing
conditions
(
LB
Log
)
regulation
of
SPI
-
1
proteins
by
Hfq
was
generally
consistent
with
the
literature
.

To
extend
our
validation
of
the
proteomics
results
we
also
directly
analyzed
protein
levels
by
Western
blot
analysis
of
selected
proteins
based
on
our
proteomics
results
.

Our
proteomics
results
showed
that
HtrA
protein
levels
were
strongly
up
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
relative
to
wildtype
in
LB
Log
,
while
OsmY
and
STM1513
were
strongly
down
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
relative
to
wildtype
in
AMM
-
1
and
LB
Stat
respectively
.

As
transcript
levels
are
often
equated
to
protein
expression
levels
,
it
was
of
particular
interest
to
determine
whether
genes
that
showed
significant
changes
in
protein
expression
also
exhibited
significant
changes
in
transcript
levels
.

Examination
of
transcript
levels
using
microarray
analysis
(
>
/
=
2
-
fold
change
)
revealed
a
more
modest
effect
on
Salmonella
transcription
,
with
approximately11
%
(
492
genes
)
and
approximately8
%
(
370
genes
)
of
the
Salmonella
Typhimurium
genome
(
4550
genes
;
[
31
]
)
under
control
of
Hfq
and
SmpB
,
respectively
(
Table
S4
)
.

The
result
for
hfq
transcriptional
analysis
is
in
general
agreement
with
previous
studies
for
Salmonella
[
10
]
and
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
[
33
]
where
approximately20
%
and
approximately15
%
of
all
genes
,
respectively
,
were
regulated
by
Hfq
,
but
slightly
higher
than
the
number
of
Hfq
-
dependent
genes
reported
for
E
.
coli
[
27
]
and
Vibrio
cholerae
[
21
]
,
approximately6
%
each
.

Of
the
781
proteins
and
492
transcripts
regulated
by
Hfq
,
113
genes
overlapped
both
sets
.

Hfq
control
of
biological
processes

While
the
role
of
Hfq
as
a
global
regulator
has
become
increasingly
appreciated
over
the
past
few
years
,
the
actual
extent
of
Hfq
regulation
of
translation
remains
unknown
.

General
metabolism
Proteome
profiling
data
suggested
Hfq
regulates
nucleoside
(
DeoABC
)
and
nucleotide
metabolism
(
CarAB
,
PurUBCMHAD
,
Ndk
)
under
AMM
conditions
,
as
well
as
regulates
ribose
metabolism
and
transport
(
RbsABK
)
under
AMM
-
2
.

Hfq
also
appears
to
play
a
significant
role
in
central
metabolism
based
on
observed
differential
regulation
of
numerous
proteins
involved
in
glycolysis
/
gluconeogenesis
,
the
TCA
pathway
,
pyruvate
decarboxylation
and
the
pentose
phosphate
shunt
(
see
Table
S1
)
.

Examination
of
the

genes
showed
no
significant
change
in
mRNA
expression
levels
relative
to
wildtype
,
suggesting
that
Hfq
provides
most
of
the
control
of
these
pathways
for
the
growth
conditions
monitored
.

Translation

Several
ribosomal
proteins
including
RpsM
,
RpsG
,
RpmD
,
and
RplN
exhibited
a
marked
reduction
in
both
protein
and
mRNA
levels
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
compared
to
the
wildtype
under
LB
Stat
growth
condition
.

One
hallmark
of
growth
under
nutrient
poor
conditions
is
lower
expression
of
the
machinery
necessary
to
synthesize
proteins
,
including
tRNA
synthetases
and
other
factors
.

In
fact
all
of
the
aminoacyl
-
tRNA
synthetases
(
IleS
,
ProS
,
CysS
,
GlnS
,
AspS
,
ArgS
,
GltX
,
AlaS
,
TrpS
,
GlyS
,
GlyQ
)
observed
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
relative
to
the
wild
type
without
a
concurrent
change
in
transcription
.

This
suggests
that
Hfq
normally
represses
translation
of
these
genes
under
conditions
that
mimics
the
intracellular
environment
(
AMM
)
.

Hfq
was
observed
to
modulate
numerous
proteins
involved
in
envelope
stress
under
AMM
-
2
conditions
,
including
FkpA
,
SurA
,
HtrA
,
NlpB
,
NmpC
,
ClpA
,
SlyD
,
RseA
,
RseB
,
RpoE
,
OmpF
,
and
HtpG
,
which
were
all
up
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
.

Proteins
involved
in
oxidative
stress
(
NarY
,
Qor
,
Dps
,
WraB
,
OxyR
,
GrxA
,
Gor
,
GrxB
,
KatG
,
KatE
,
SodC
,
SodB
,
AhpF
)
;
acid
stress
(
CadA
)
;
and
starvation
(
SspA
,
SspB
)
were
all
also
differentially
regulated
by
Hfq
(
Table
S1
)
.

Many
of
these
genes
are
required
for
virulence
as
discussed
in
more
detail
below
.

For
example
rpoE
has
been
shown
to
be
required
for
the
virulence
of
Salmonella
Typhimurium
[
35
]
.

Two
RpoE
-
regulated
genes
,
htrA
and
surA
,
have
also
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
Salmonella
virulence
[
35
]
,
[
36
]
,
[
37
]
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
the
periplasmic
Cu
,
Zn
-
superoxide
dismutase
sodC
to
contribute
to
Salmonella
virulence
in
mice
[
39
]
,
[
40
]
.

LPS
(
lipopolysaccharide
)
has
long
been
known
as
an
essential
component
of
virulence
of
Gram
negative
pathogens
and
,
more
recently
,
the
agonist
for
toll
like
receptor
4
.

LpxA
and
LpxD
involved
in
Lipid
A
synthesis
,
TolC
involved
in
LPS
Core
completion
,
as
well
as
proteins
involved
in
O
-
antigen
synthesis
(
RfbACKMGJU
)
,
appeared
as
up
-
regulated
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
suggesting
that
Hfq
may
normally
down
regulate
expression
within
the
host
.

Complementary
transcriptional
analysis
revealed
no
change
in
the
corresponding
mRNA
levels
relative
to
the
wildtype
.

Reduced
expression
of
LPS
and
alterations
in
LPS
modification
has
been
reported
for
intracellular
Salmonella
[
41
]
,
[
42
]
,
[
43
]
.

Our
results
suggest
Hfq
plays
a
role
in
the
post
-
transcriptional
regulation
of
several
two
component
systems
including
three
that
have
been
shown
to
be
essential
for
virulence
in
a
variety
of
animal
models
;
SsrA
/
B
,
PhoP
/
Q
,
and
OmpR
/
EnvZ
.

Two
component
systems
are
widespread
methods
of
sensing
external
conditions
and
responding
by
altering
gene
expression
in
prokaryotes
,
eukaryotes
and
archaea
.

Well
known
two
component
regulators
respond
to
osmolarity
,
nitrogen
and
oxygen
limitation
[
44
]
,
[
45
]
.

Microarray
analysis
showed
no
effect
on
transcription
of
these
genes
.

Salmonella
motility
enhances
cell
contact
thereby
increasing
host
cell
invasion
.

A
recent
study
showed
that
an
Deltahfq
mutant
that
was
non
-
motile
exhibited
an
invasion
defect
[
20
]
.

Consistent
with
this
previous
study
,
we
observed
reduced
expression
of
SPI
-
1
invasion
proteins
and
numerous
motility
proteins
in
the
Deltahfq
mutant
strain
primarily
in
the
log
phase
growth
condition
compared
to
the
wildtype
strain
.

Propanediol
,
derived
from
rhamnose
and
fucose
catabolism
,
is
degraded
by
products
of
the
propanediol
utilization
(
pdu
)
operon
(
immediately
adjacent
to
the
cob
operon
)
in
a
vitamin
B12
dependent
manner
.

This
allows
Salmonella
Typhimurium
to
grow
using
propanediol
as
a
sole
carbon
source
and
because
it
is
required
for
growth
in
macrophages
this
may
be
the
preferred
intracellular
metabolite
[
47
]
.

Western
blot
analysis
of
PduA
and
PduE
relative
protein
levels
validated
results
from
the
proteomics
analysis
(
Figures
4B
,
4C
and
4E
,
4F
)
.

The
strong
regulation
of
Pdu
protein
expression
by
Hfq
suggests
the
pdu
operon
to
be
a
potential
target
of
sRNA
regulation
and
that
correct
coordinate
expression
may
be
essential
for
activity
.

The
normal
function
of
SmpB
is
in
quality
control
to
free
ribosomes
stalled
on
defective
mRNAs
[
11
]
,
[
16
]
.

However
,
results
from
our
global
proteomics
analysis
indicate
that
SmpB
directly
or
indirectly
modulates
the
expression
of
at
least
4
%
of
the
entire
Salmonella
Typhimurium
proteome
determined
from
ANOVA
analysis
(
p
<
0
.
05
)
(
Table
S1
)
.

The
majority
of
genes
encoding
these
proteins
showed
no
changes
in
mRNA
level
thus
it
is
interesting
to
speculate
an
additional
role
for
SmpB
as
a
general
post
-
transcriptional
/
translational
regulator
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
.

We
note
however
that
a
more
detailed
and
rigorous
analysis
is
required
to
confirm
the
speculated
global
regulatory
role
of
SmpB
.

Proteins
involved
in
motility
in
Salmonella
Typhimurium
also
showed
down
-
regulation
during
growth
in
LB
media
.

This
set
of
proteins
included
the
chemotaxis
proteins
CheZ
,
CheY
,
CheW
,
CheA
and
Tsr
as
well
as
the
flagellar
proteins
FliC
,
FliD
,
FliG
and
FljB
.

This
suggests
that
a
more
thorough
examination
of
the
role
of
SmpB
in
the
regulation
of
cell
motility
and
histidine
biosynthesis
is
warranted
.

We
were
interested
in
determining
whether
there
was
overlap
in
translational
regulation
between
Hfq
and
SmpB
i
.
e
.
,
the
extent
of
cross
-
talk
or
level
of
co
-
ordination
if
any
between
these
two
translational
regulators
(
Table
S1
)
.

For
logarithmic
phase
growth
conditions
,
the
expression
pattern
of
242
proteins
appeared
to
exhibit
a
dependence
on
Hfq
,
while
37
proteins
exhibited
a
dependency
on
SmpB
.

Twenty
proteins
overlapped
both
sets
,
including
the
motility
proteins
FliC
,
CheA
,
CheZ
and
Tsr
.

Under
stationary
phase
growth
conditions
270
proteins
appeared
to
be
under
control
of
Hfq
and
27
proteins
under
control
of
SmpB
.

Of
the
390
proteins
regulated
by
Hfq
and
50
proteins
regulated
by
SmpB
in
growth
in
AMM
-
2
,
15
proteins
were
co
-
regulated
by
both
Hfq
and
SmpB
,
including
the
invasion
protein
PrgI
,
MdoH
involved
in
the
synthesis
of
membrane
-
derived
oligosaccharide
,
and
a
putative
periplasmic
protein
CreA
.

Under
growth
in
AMM
-
1
267
proteins
appeared
regulated
by
Hfq
and
the
expression
pattern
of
86
proteins
exhibited
a
dependence
on
SmpB
.

Twenty
four
of
these
proteins
were
co
-
regulated
by
both
Hfq
and
SmpB
.

Summary

Using
a
sample
-
matched
procedure
our
strategy
simultaneously
measures
changes
in
global
transcript
and
protein
abundance
levels
allowing
for
a
clear
distinction
between
the
transcriptional
and
post
-
transcriptional
effects
of
Hfq
or
SmpB
.

Furthermore
,
our
strategy
requires
no
tagging
and
or
isolation
of
Hfq
or
SmpB
precluding
the
possibility
of
spurious
results
introduced
by
tagging
and
or
co
-
immunoprecipitation
processes
.

Previous
attempts
to
identify
processes
/
targets
regulated
by
Hfq
,
and
thus
targets
of
sRNA
regulation
,
have
relied
on
transcript
-
centric
approaches
.

The
result
of
this
work
was
very
surprising
namely
that
Hfq
bound
to
20
%
of
all
Salmonella
mRNA
transcripts
and
at
least
64
small
RNA
molecules
.

One
possible
criticism
of
this
work
is
that
the
RNA
co
-
immunoprecipitated
with
Hfq
may
be
brought
down
simply
because
Hfq
strongly
binds
to
RNA
molecules
and
that
the
binding
is
somewhat
non
-
specific
.

Our
efforts
presented
here
support
the
conclusions
of
that
study
and
suggest
that
an
even
larger
number
of
Salmonella
proteins
are
translationally
regulated
than
the
20
%
suggested
by
these
authors
,
when
accessed
across
a
larger
number
of
growth
conditions
.

These
results
have
been
validated
by
Western
blotting
to
a
number
of
proteins
.

The
amount
of
translational
regulation
varied
with
growth
conditions
.

During
growth
in
rich
media
approximately
14
%
of
all
proteins
observed
showed
differences
in
abundance
where
as
in
acidic
minimal
media
the
result
was
approximately21
%
.

These
results
may
explain
the
very
high
LD50
of
the
hfq
mutant
strain
(
>
109
i
.
p
.
)
and
its
growth
defect
even
in
rich
media
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
adaptive
evolution
experiments
using
a
chemostat
to
continuously
alter
grow
conditions
often
results
in
changes
in
Hfq
(
Bernard
Palsson
,
UCSD
,
personal
communication
)
.

It
has
long
been
known
that
many
proteins
are
transcriptionally
regulated
.

These
results
and
the
results
recently
described
by
Sittka
et
al
.

[
10
]
demonstrate
that
post
-
transcriptional
/
translational
regulation
plays
as
large
a
role
in
controlling
the
myriad
of
bacterial
processes
as
does
transcriptional
regulation
.

It
is
the
precisely
this
ability
to
rapidly
adjust
to
changing
conditions
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
make
an
RNA
molecule
that
makes
this
a
pivotal
regulatory
process
.

were
found

The

shared

between
the

Conclusion
This

identifies
set
of
genes
induced
in
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
upon
infection
of
R
.
majalis
,
and
highlights
differences
in
molecular
features
used
by
these
two
closely
related
bacteria
to
promote
their
pathogenicity
in
the
same
insect
host
.

Background

They
naturally
colonize
intestines
of
the
nematode
infective
juveniles
which
invade
susceptible
insects
to
release
the
bacteria
into
the
hemolymph
.

The
bacteria
multiply
in
the
hemolymph
,
killing
the
insect
host
within
24
-
48
h
and
converting
the
cadaver
into
a
food
source
suitable
for
nematode
growth
and
reproduction
.

After
1
-
3
rounds
of
nematode
reproduction
,
the
bacteria
recolonize
the
emerging
infective
juveniles
ensuring
their
transmission
to
a
new
host
[
1
]
.

The
published
genome
sequence
of
Photorhabdus
luminescens
TT01
strain
indicates
that
virulence
genes
are
encoded
within
a
number
of
pathogenicity
islands
located
on
the
bacterial
chromosome
[
4
,
5
]
.

The
two
bacteria
differ
in
mechanisms
by
which
they
evade
host
immune
responses
.

For
example
,
in
Photorhabdus
,
mutational
inactivation
of
phoP
gene
results
in
increased
sensitivity
to
insect
immune
response
and
decreased
virulence
towards
insects
[
6
,
7
]
,
while
in
X
.
nematophila
,
phoPQ
mutants
are
more
susceptible
to
immune
response
but
are
fully
virulent
[
3
]
.

P
.
luminescens
produces
a
signaling
molecule
AI
-
2
to
resist
reactive
oxygen
species
[
8
]
and
phenylpropanoid
chemical
ST
to
inhibit
the
activity
of
antimicrobial
enzyme
PO
and
formation
of
melanotic
nodules
[
9
]
,
but
the
strategy
used
by
X
.
nematophila
appears
to
be
that
of
suppression
of
transcripts
involved
in
the
insect
immune
response
[
10
-
12
]
.

In
addition
,
P
.
luminescens
encodes
a
type
III
secretion
system
and
one
of
the
effectors
,
LopT
,
suppresses
phagocytosis
and
reduces
nodulation
by
haemocytes
[
13
,
14
]
.

However
,
the
genomes
of
Xenorhabdus
bovienii
and
X
.
nematophila
do
not
show
homologues
of
LopT
or
a
dedicated
type
III
secretion
system
[
3
]
,
and
Xenorhabdus
likely
uses
flagellar
regulatory
cascade
to
control
cellular
immunity
[
15
]
.

Despite
the
identification
of
the
above
regulatory
and
virulence
factors
from
Photorhabdus
and
Xenorhabdus
,
the
full
profiles
of
genes
expressed
during
insect
infection
by
these
two
closely
related
bacteria
are
unknown
.

Munch
et
al
.

[
16
]
identified
29
promoters
induced
by
P
.
luminescens
in
the
presence
of
isolated
Galleria
mellonella
homogenate
using
a
differential
fluorescence
induction
approach
.

However
,
treatment
with
insect
homogenate
might
neglect
physicochemical
parameters
as
inducers
which
could
result
in
different
sets
of
genes
being
upregulated
during
natural
infection
of
live
insects
.

However
,
unlike
their
nematode
partners
,
both
bacterial
species
are
highly
virulent
to
Rhizotrogus
majalis
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
two
bacteria
species
will
use
both
common
and
distinct
molecular
mechanisms
during
infection
of
the
same
insect
host
.

Results

Isolation

To

Random

were
normalized
by

to

that

using

,
resulting
in
sampling
of
bacterial

transcripts
apart
from
its

.

To

and
analyzed
using
the
non

redundant
algorithms
of
BLAST
in
NCBI
and
database
of
Xenorhabdus
Genomes
.

These
sequenced
clones
were
therefore
considered
to
represent
reliable
transcripts
specifically
expressed
in
P
.
temperata
or
X
.
koppenhoeferi
after
24
h
infection
of
R
.
majalis
.

For
both
bacteria
,
each
isolated
transcript
was
identified
at
least
twice
from
the
sequenced
clones
.

The
coverage
of
in
vivo
enriched
libraries
was
then
evaluated
using
Analytic
Rarefaction
according
to
the
redundancy
of
each
identical
transcript
in
the
sequenced
clones
.

As
indicated
by
the
rarefaction
curves
(
Fig
.

)
,
saturation
was
achieved
for
the
sequenced
clones
,
indicating
that
most
of
representative
genes
in
the
in
vivo
enriched
cDNA
libraries
were
identified
.

Totally
,
we
isolated
40
different
sequences
from
P
.
temperata
(
Table

)
and
39
from
X

koppenhoeferi
(
Table

.

Genes

about
25
%
to
33
%
of
the
total
number
of
in

(

,
showing
large
numbers
of

during

Also
gyrase
A

,
a
prokaryotic

,
was
not

,
but
was
detected
in
all
other
cDNA
populations
including
in

and
in

cDNAs
before
and
after
normalization
,
indicating
that
only
differentially
expressed
genes
were
captured
after
enrichment
.

Twenty
nine
of
the
40
distinct
P
.
temperata
transcripts
have
similar
sequences
in
X

koppenhoeferi
genome
,
thus
11
were

30
of
the
39
distinct

koppenhoeferi

share

,
thus
9
were

.

Further
,
the
level
of
changes
in
the
transcripts
exclusively
induced
in

of

Analysis
of
biological
associations
of
in
vivo
-
induced
genes

To
understand
the
function
and
interactions
of
the
identified
gene
products
,
interactive
networks
were
built
to
provide
an
overview
of
how
gene
products
relate
to
each
other
by
leveraging
databases
of
published
literature
.

Using
PathwayStudio
(
Ariadne
,
Rockville
,
MD
,
USA
)
program
,
we
were
able
to
distill
all
published
information
about
biological
relationships
of
bacterial
homologs
of
the
identified
genes
.

Based
on
this
analysis
,
the
biological
significance
of
each
gene
was
inferred
.

Linkage
between
proteins
shows
how
upregulated
genes
may
influence
other
genes
or
gene
products
.

For
example
,
gene
rpoB
,
induced
in
both
bacteria
,
interacts
with
many
gene
products
,
suggesting
its
overall
importance
during
insect
infection
(
see
Additional
files
1
and
2
)
.

Other
identified
genes
with
multiple
connections
to
different
gene
products
were
different
between
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
indicating
distinct
biological
processes
used
by
the
two
bacteria
for
insect
infection
.

For
example
,
regulation
of
genes
yncB
and
purH
in
P
.
temperata
are
influenced
by
aromatic
compounds
and
formate
,
respectively
(
see
Additional
file
1
)
.

Some
products
encoded
by
induced
genes
were
found
to
interact
with
as
many
as
eight
other
gene
products
in
the
network
.

For
example
,
P
.
temperata
pckA
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
aceE
both
influence
8
other
genes
in
the
network
(
see
Additional
file
3
)
.

As
a
whole
,
the
protein
networks
of
the
identified
genes
were
different
for
the
two
bacteria
except
that
NAD
synthetase
gene
nadE
was
found
to
be
common
to
both
bacteria
.

Our
gene
expression
data
reveal
similarities
and
differences
in
molecular
mechanisms
of
pathogenicity
by
the
two
bacteria
with
apparently
similar
biology
.

Genes
involved
in
cell
structure
modification
As
the
physical
contact
between
bacteria
and
their
host
is
accomplished
by
the
outer
surface
,
the
bacterial
cell
envelope
is
crucial
for
communication
and
interaction
with
host
cells
during
infection
.

Genes
involved
in
the
synthesis
of
outer
membrane
proteins
(
skp
in
P
.
temperata
and
ompF
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
)
and
flagella
(
fliA
in
P
.
temperata
and
fliM
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
)
were
induced
in
both
bacteria
,
indicating
the
importance
of
surface
proteins
in
this
bacteria
-
insect
interface
.

Gene
dacC
encoding
a
peptidoglycan
synthesis
enzyme
D
-
alanyl
-
D
-
alanine
carboxypeptidase
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
but
not
in
P
.
temperata
,
implying
that
peptidoglycan
undergoes
structural
alterations
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
that
probably
add
to
its
fitness
when
residing
in
the
host
.

PhoP
and
CpxR
are
dual
transcriptional
regulators
that
are
activated
in
response
to
environmental
stimuli
and
then
act
to
modulate
activity
of
other
genes
[
23
,
24
]
.

Responding
to
low
Mg2
+
levels
,
phoP
expression
is
auto
-
regulated
by
PhoP
and
PhoQ
proteins
and
phoQ
is
constitutive
[
25
]
.

Auto
-
regulation
of
phoP
likely
regulates
expression
of
other
genes
that
mediate
various
cellular
functions
such
as
LPS
modification
,
cell
structure
[
26
]
,
and
type
III
secretion
systems
[
27
]
.

Similarly
,
the
regulatory
protein
CpxR
can
be
activated
in
response
to
signals
associated
with
growth
and
metabolic
pathways
[
28
]
.

Sometimes
,
CpxR
acts
to
modulate
other
transcriptional
factors
[
30
]
.

Although
there
is
no
evidence
showing
links
between
phoP
/
cpxR
and
other
isolated
genes
,
overexpression
of
these
two
response
regulator
genes
may
possibly
relate
to
genes
involved
in
stress
responses
(
gshB
,
gor
,
msrA
and
surA
)
,
cell
structure
(
skp
,
dacC
and
ompF
)
and
type
III
secretion
systems
(
sctL
)
identified
in
this
study
.

Further
,
in
P
.
temperata
,
lysR
gene
encoding
a
transcriptional
activator
protein
was
found
to
be
upregulated
during
infection
of
R
.
majalis
,
while
two
genes
yijC
and
rseA
encoding
transcriptional
repressors
were
identified
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

The
pathway
network
analysis
indicates
that
the
product
of
yijC
may
function
as
a
repressor
to
potentially
control
the
expression
of
the
fabB
gene
,
which
in
turn
,
modulates
the
physical
properties
of
the
membrane
by
altering
the
level
of
unsaturated
fatty
acid
production
.

Besides
transcriptional
regulatory
genes
,
gene
tilS
,
encoding
a
putative
cell
cycle
protein
[
4
]
,
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

However
,
none
of
these
regulatory
factors
were
identified
in
P
.
luminescens
exposed
to
G
.
mellonella
homogenate
in
a
previous
study
[
16
]
,
suggesting
that
regulation
of
these
factors
either
depends
on
host
(
R
.
majalis
not
G
.
mellonella
)
or
bacteria
themselves
.

Genes
involved
in
virulence
and
secretion

Subsequently
,
bacterial
virulence
factors
actively
contribute
to
a
successful
infection
by
colonization
of
and
toxicity
towards
the
insect
host
.

Among
the
virulence
genes
identified
in
this
study
,
tcaC
was
identified
to
be
induced
in
both
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
during
infection
of
R
.
majalis
.

The
tca
gene
family
encodes
four
toxin
complexes
TcaA
,
TcaB
,
TcaC
and
TcaD
[
33
]
,
and
has
been
found
in
several
bacterial
pathogens
including
P
.
luminescens
,
Yersinia
and
Xenorhabdus
[
34
]
.

Interestingly
,
Tca
toxin
encoding
genes
were
also
found
to
be
induced
in
a
related
species
P
.
luminescens
treated
with
the
homogenate
of
G
.
mellonella
[
16
]
.

[
36
]
.

Induction
of
gene
pplA
,
encoding
a
phospholipase
,
in
P
.
temperata
is
expected
to
contribute
to
its
faster
growth
rate
[
37
]
compared
to
X
.
koppenhoeferi
in
R
.
majalis
.

Further
,
genes
encoding
components
of
different
types
of
secretion
machineries
were
isolated
in
this
study
.

Notably
,
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
virH
with
sequence
similarity
to
a
gene
encoding
putative
toxin
secretion
transporter
in
Vibrio
cholera
,
was
upregulated
during
infection
of
R
.
majalis
.

Compared
to
all
other
functional
classes
,
more
stress
response
genes
were
identified
to
be
shared
by
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
,
suggesting
common
themes
in
adaptation
to
host
-
imposed
stresses
.

Similarly
,
induction
of
a
chaperone
protein
encoding
gene
dnaK
in
both
bacteria
may
picture
common
stress
responses
between
P
.
temperata
and
X
.
koppenhoeferi
in
a
number
of
cellular
processes
including
rescue
of
misfolded
proteins
and
control
of
the
activity
of
folded
regulatory
proteins
[
46
]
.

The
glutathione
synthetase
gene
gshB
which
mediates
condensation
of
gamma
-
glutamylcysteine
and
glycine
to
form
glutathione
[
47
,
48
]
was
induced
in
P
.
temperata
,
but
glutathione
reductase
gene
gor
which
reduces
glutathione
disulfide
to
the
sulfhydryl
form
of
glutathione
[
47
,
48
]
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

Glutathione
plays
a
major
role
in
protection
against
oxidative
stress
and
in
detoxification
of
hazardous
chemicals
or
heavy
metals
[
49
]
.

Further
,
as
Photorhabdus
and
Xenorhabdus
bacteria
can
switch
their
phenotypes
upon
insect
infection
,
we
speculate
that
upregulation
of
transposase
genes
in
both
bacteria
may
contribute
to
genetic
variability
for
better
adaptation
and
survival
in
a
particular
niche
[
50
]
.

Apart
from
the
common
mechanisms
handling
stresses
,
gene
msrA
encoding
a
peptide
methionine
sulfoxide
reductase
was
unique
to
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

As
an
important
antioxidant
enzyme
,
peptide
methionine
sulfoxide
reductase
mediates
the
repair
of
proteins
damaged
by
sulfoxidation
of
methionine
residues
[
51
,
52
]
.

Three
genes
,
aceE
,
aceK
and
dld
,
whose
products
catalyze
subsequent
steps
of
the
glyoxylate
pathway
[
53
]
,
were
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

In
contrast
,
two
genes
kdgK
and
pckA
involved
in
energy
metabolism
in
the
TCA
cycle
were
upregulated
in
P
.
temperata
[
54
,
55
]
.

Induction
of
different
amino
acid
biosynthetic
genes
may
suggest
the
differences
in
amino
acid
requirements
in
the
two
bacteria
during
infection
.

Induction
of
cysK
gene
in
P
.
temperata
suggests
that
cysteine
may
be
required
when
growing
in
the
insect
,
but
lysine
may
be
needed
for
X
.
koppenhoeferi
as
lysC
gene
was
induced
.

Isolation
of
P
.
temperata
def
,
encoding
an
amino
acid
tRNA
synthesis
enzyme
N
-
formylmethionylaminoacyl
-
tRNA
deformylase
,
may
reflect
the
importance
of
specific
amino
acids
involved
in
the
translation
process
during
growth
in
the
insect
host
.

Genes
involved
in
protein
synthesis
and
degradation
can
also
be
distinguished
between
the
two
bacteria
.

A
protease
gene
,
clpP
,
involved
in
protein
degradation
,
was
induced
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
upon
infection
.

In
fact
proteases
have
been
identified
as
virulence
factors
in
some
other
bacterial
pathogens
[
59
]
.

The
signal
peptidase
II
encoded
by
lspA
gene
induced
in
P
.
temperata
belongs
to
a
class
of
aspartyl
proteases
.

Since
the
product
of
lspA
has
been
suggested
as
an
important
virulence
factor
operating
via
maturation
of
several
lipoproteins
[
60
]
,
we
postulate
that
the
product
of
lspA
may
play
a
pathological
role
in
P
.
temperata
by
cleaving
some
core
proteins
and
thus
influencing
bacterial
life
cycle
in
the
insect
host
.

In
addition
to
ion
scavenging
systems
,
artM
,
encoding
a
putative
ABC
amino
acid
transport
system
[
63
]
was
identified
in
P
.
temperata
,
but
not
in
X
.
koppenhoeferi
.

Besides
transporting
L
-
arginine
across
the
inner
membrane
[
63
]
,
the
pathway
network
reveals
that
the
product
of
artM
participates
in
cystine
transport
(
see
Additional
file
1
)
,
suggesting
that
this
gene
may
also
mediate
cystine
amino
acid
acquisition
.

As
cysteine
synthesis
gene
cysK
was
also
identified
from
P
.
temperata
as
discussed
above
,
it
may
indicate
that
the
level
of
cysteine
either
synthesized
by
P
.
temperata
or
acquired
from
the
insect
host
is
not
sufficient
during
infection
.

Interestingly
,
X
.
koppenhoeferi
seems
to
require
sugar
as
malF
gene
which
is
involved
in
uptake
for
maltose
and
lactose
was
upregulated
.

As
a
periplasmic
protein
,
TolB
is
an
extra
member
in
the
Tol
system
.

In
E
.
coli
,
Tol
system
stabilizes
the
outer
membrane
structure
and
mutations
in
Tol
encoding
genes
result
in
hypersensitivity
to
deleterious
agents
[
65
]
.

Genes
with
unknown
function

Many
virulence
factors
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
,
namely
capsular
polysaccharides
,
RTX
toxins
,
LPS
and
many
iron
acquisition
systems
.

In
order
to
identify
genes
that
are
expressed
in
vivo
during
a
natural
infection
,
we
undertook
transcript
profiling
experiments
with
an
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
DNA
microarray
,
after
recovery
of
bacterial
mRNAs
from
serotype
5b
-
infected
porcine
lungs
.

Results
Transcriptional
profiling
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
recovered
from
the
lung
of
a
pig
suffering
from
a
natural
infection
or
following
growth
of
the
bacterial
isolate
in
BHI
medium
was
performed
.

An
RNA
extraction
protocol
combining
beadbeating
and
hot
-
acid
-
phenol
was
developed
in
order
to
maximize
bacterial
mRNA
yields
and
quality
following
total
RNA
extraction
from
lung
lesions
.

Nearly
all
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
transcripts
could
be
detected
on
our
microarrays
,
and
150
genes
were
deemed
differentially
expressed
in
vivo
during
the
acute
phase
of
the
infection
.

These
transcriptional
profiling
data
,
combined
with
previous
comparative
genomic
hybridizations
performed
by
our
group
,
revealed
that
66
out
of
the
72
up
-
regulated
genes
are
conserved
amongst
all
serotypes
and
that
3
of
them
code
for
products
that
are
predicted
outer
membrane
proteins
(
genes
irp
and
APL

0959
,
predicted
to
code
for
a
TonB
-
dependent
receptor
and
a
filamentous
hemagglutinin
/
adhesin
respectively
)
or
lipoproteins
(
gene
APL
_
0920
)
.

Transmission
occurs
through
aerosol
or
close
contact
with
infected
animals
or
asymptomatic
carriers
,
and
can
affect
pigs
of
all
ages
[
2
]
.

Animals
that
survive
the
infection
often
become
healthy
carriers
,
and
develop
localized
necrotizing
lesions
associated
with
pleuritis
[
3
]
.

Fifteen
different
serotypes
can
be
identified
based
on
differences
in
capsular
polysaccharides
.

While
serotypes
1
to
12
and
15
usually
belong
to
biotype
1
,
which
contains
strains
that
are
NAD

dependent
,
serotypes
13
and
14
are
usually
NAD

independent
and
belong
to
biotype

pleuropneumoniae
pathogenicity
are
still
not
fully
understood
.

In
order
to
gain
new
insight
into
the
disease
,
researchers
have
relied
on
techniques
that
allow
for
the
identification
of
genes
expressed
in
bacteria
during
infection
of
the
host
[

]
,
namely
In

Technology
(
IVET
)
,
Signature
Tagged
Mutagenesis
(
STM
)
and
Selective
Capture
of
Transcribed
Sequences
(
SCOTS
)
.

First
,
an
IVET
experiment
with
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
led
to
the
identification
of
10
loci
(
termed
ivi
)
transcribed
in
vivo
[
12
]
and
highlighted
the
importance
of
genes
involved
in
branched
-
chain
amino
acid
(
BCAA
)
synthesis
[
13
,
14
]
.

Later
,
over
the
course
of
two
STM
experiments
conducted
with
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
nearly
3000
mutants
were
screened
in
vivo
[
15
,
16
]
.

Both
experiments
showed
that
iron
acquisition
was
highly
important
for
the
virulence
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
with
the
identification
of
mutants
impaired
for
the
ExbB
-
ExbD
-
TonB
energy
-
transducing
system
.

The
HlyX
regulon
was
characterized
recently
,
and
iron
-
regulated
protein
B
(
FrpB
)
was
identified
as
a
potentially
important
virulence
factor
up
-
regulated
when
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
is
grown
in
oxygen
-
deprived
environments
[
20
]
.

Although
these
in
vivo
studies
have
been
very
valuable
in
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
involved
in
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
pathogenesis
,
limitations
associated
with
the
techniques
used
lead
only
to
a
partial
overview
of
the
transcriptional
events
taking
place
in
vivo
.

DNA
microarrays
have
been
used
to
determine
the
complete
transcriptomic
profile
of
microorganisms
in
vitro
,
but
technical
drawbacks
that
are
associated
with
the
use
of
this
technique
in
vivo
,
such
as
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
recovery
of
bacterial
RNA
from
host
tissues
,
explain
why
the
use
of
this
technique
to
monitor
bacterial
infections
has
been
limited
[
21
]
.

While
various
cell
culture
,
ex
-
vivo
or
mouse
infection
models
have
been
used
,
in
vivo
experiments
can
provide
more
accurate
information
on
bacterial
adaptation
and
virulence
when
the
natural
host
is
studied
.

Our
results
indicate
that
150
genes
are
differentially
expressed
during
the
acute
phase
of
infection
in
the
host
.

Results
and
discussion

Animal
samples
While
working
with
samples
from
commercial
herds
means
that
we
are
working
with
disease
cases
that
are
representative
of
what
is
really
happening
in
the
field
,
it
also
means
that
limited
amounts
of
material
is
available
.

Two
animals
died
as
a
result
of
the
infection
,
and
were
sampled
a
few
hours
after
death
.

Those
samples
were
not
used
for
the
microarray
experiments
since
significant
transcriptomic
changes
might
have
occurred
between
the
time
of
death
and
the
time
of
sampling
.

The
last
animal
was
euthanized
on
site
by
a
veterinarian
,
and
sampled
less
than
5
minutes
after
death
.

While
it
can
be
argued
that
different
animals
might
react
differently
to
an
infection
by
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
and
therefore
elicit
different
transcriptional
changes
in
the
pathogen
,
we
are
confident
that
the
results
that
were
obtained
reflect
accurately
the
conditions
encountered
by
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
in
its
natural
host
following
acute
infection
.

Macroscopic
and
microscopic
observations

Clinical
signs
and
macroscopic
and
microscopic
examinations
were
consistent
with
acute
porcine
pleuropneumonia
.

Clinical
signs
ranged
from
depression
to
respiratory
distress
,
while
macroscopic
observation
of
deceased
pigs
revealed
lobar
fibrinohemorrhagic
pleuropneumonia
,
along
with
necrotic
lesions
and
the
accumulation
of
bloody
fluid
in
the
thorax
.

The
infectious
field
strain
that
was
isolated
from
the
lung
tissues
was
named
896
-
07
,
and
serotyping
analysis
showed
that
it
belongs
to
serotype
5b
,
one
of
the
most
prevalent
in
North
America
[
4
]
.

Comparative
genomic
hybridizations

CGH
experiments
conducted
previously
in
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
the
majority
of
genes
in
the
reference
5b
L20
strain
were
conserved
in
reference
strains
and
fresh
field
isolates
.

In
order
to
validate
its
use
to
assess
transcriptomic
events
taking
place
with
our
infectious
field
strain
during
the
infection
,
we
first
used
it
to
analyze
the
gene
content
of
the
896
-
07
field
strain
.

The
CGH
data
obtained
with
strain
896
-
07
was
added
to
that
obtained
with
other
field
and
reference
strains
[
25
]
in
order
to
generate
a
strain
dendogram
(
Figure
2
)
.

The
same
clusters
as
those
observed
previously
could
be
found
in
our
dendrogram
[
25
]
.

Only
28
genes
were
identified
as
divergent
/
absent
in
our
field
strain
,
when
compared
to
the
reference
serotype
5b
L20
strain
(
Table
1
)
.

This
represents
only
1
.
43
%
of
all
the
genes
(
1954
)
that
are
represented
on
AppChip2
[
25
]
.

The
other
important
locus
for
gene
divergence
/
absence
was
composed
of
phage
-
related
features
,
and
these
were
shown
to
be
divergent
during
inter
and
intra
-
serotype
comparisons
in
previous
experiments
[
25
]
.

RNA
extraction

This
size
of
beads
is
too
large
to
lyse
bacterial
cells
(
Biospec
,
personal
communication
)
.

Following
homogenization
,
serial
dilutions
of
the
resulting
supernatant
were
plated
in
order
to
determine
an
approximate
number
of
CFU
per
gram
of
tissue
.

Our
results
indicated
that
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
could
easily
be
isolated
in
pure
culture
from
lung
tissues
of
all
animals
,
and
that
the
number
of
CFU
varied
from
1
x
106
to
1
x
107
per
gram
of
infected
tissue
.

Nevertheless
,
the
MicrobENRICH
kit
was
still
used
to
remove
any
possible
trace
of
remaining
eukaryotic
RNA
,
and
treatments
with
TurboDNase
removed
traces
of
contaminating
DNA
.

We
propose
that
this
combination
of
techniques
could
prove
useful
in
isolating
pathogens
from
other
tissues
as
well
.

Duplicate
experiments
showed
a
R2
correlation
factor
of
0
.
996
between
the
intensity
detected
for
the
Cy3
labelled
and
Cy5
labelled
probes
,
and
only
two
genes
seemed
to
qualify
as
obvious
outliers
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Both
genes
,
APL
_
1141
and
APL
_
0484
,
were
not
identified
as
differentially
expressed
during
the
course
of
a
natural
infection
.

While
designing
the
microarray
experiments
,
growth
in
BHI
medium
to
an
optical
density
of
0
.
3
at
a
600
nm
wavelenght
was
chosen
as
our
reference
condition
.

This
condition
was
not
only
chosen
for
practical
reasons
,
but
also
to
fulfill
two
precise
objectives
:
first
,
to
allow
for
the
identification
of
genes
that
,
while
important
to
the
infection
process
,
have
not
been
identified
previously
in
vitro
in
rich
medium
,
and
second
,
to
allow
comparison
of
the
results
obtained
in
vivo
to
those
obtained
in
our
laboratory
in
other
growth
conditions
by
keeping
the
same
reference
[
28
-
30
]
.

Working
with
a
limited
amount
of
biological
material
meant
that
only
one
time
-
point
in
the
infection
could
be
investigated
.

In
the
acute
stage
of
porcine
pleuropneumonia
,
bacteria
are
likely
in
the
exponential
phase
of
growth
.

This
is
also
the
case
in
the
control
condition
.

The
transcriptome
of
A
.
pleuropneumonia
is
certainly
very
different
when
the
infection
is
in
the
chronic
stage
.

Therefore
,
while
our
results
are
an
accurate
representation
of
the
transcriptomic
events
that
occur
in
vivo
during
the
acute
phase
of
the
infection
process
as
compared
to
those
occuring
in
vitro
in
a
rich
culture
medium
,
events
occuring
earlier
of
later
in
the
infection
process
cannot
be
inferred
.

A
large
number
of
genes
encoding
"
Hypothetical
/
Unknown
/
Unclassified
"
products
were
differentially
expressed
.

Three
of
these
are
involved
in
surface
structures
,
namely
LPS
and
capsule
,
biosynthesis
(
genes
kpsF
,
cps5b
and
cpxC
)
,
and
two
others
are
found
in
phage
-
associated
regions
(
APL
_
0512
and
APL
_
0524
)
.

a
)
Validation
of
microarray
results
by
qRT
-
PCR
In
order
to
confirm
results
obtained
using
the
AppChip2
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
microarray
,
eleven
genes
were
selected
for
qRT
-
PCR
analysis
.

Five
of
these
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
(
sohB
,
hbpA
,
kpsF
,
apxIVA
,
phoR
)
and
six
were
down
-
regulated
(
nlpI
,
visC
,
proQ
,
APL
_
1456
,
APL
_
1135
and
nusG
)
.

These
genes
represented
a
large
range
of
log2
ratio
values
.

In
all
cases
,
microarray
results
were
supported
by
those
obtained
by
qRT
-
PCR
:
all
genes
that
were
identified
as
up
-
regulated
using
the
AppChip2
also
showed
up
-
regulation
following
qRT
-
PCR
analysis
,
and
the
same
was
true
for
selected
down
-
regulated
genes
(
Figure

)
.

Comparison
with
other
in
vivo
studies

Among
previous
in
vivo
experiments
that
were
conducted
with
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
the
one
that
was
closest
to
ours
in
terms
of
experimental
conditions
and
results
was
by
Baltes
et
al
[
18
]
.

These
include
3
genes
already
identified
by
Baltes
et
al
.
using
SCOTS
at
the
end
of
the
acute
stage
of
the
disease
[
18
]
:
fucI
,
encoding
the
L
-
fucose
isomerase
,
nrdD
,
encoding
an
anaerobic
ribonucleoside
triphosphate
reductase
,
and
apxIVA
,
encoding
the
ApxIVA
toxin
structural
protein
.

The
latter
,
the
gene
encoding
the
recently
discovered
fourth
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
Apx
toxin
[
31
]
,
had
only
been
detected
in
vivo
[
32
-
34
]
until
it
was
discovered
recently
that
it
is
also
up
-
regulated
after
contact
with
broncho
-
alveolar
lavage
fluids
[
30
]
.

Finally
,
the
last
gene
that
was
up
-
regulated
in
our
study
and
identified
in
another
in
vivo
study
is
nanE
,
which
codes
for
a
putative
N
-
acetylmannosamine
-
6
-
phosphate
2
-
epimerase
,
an
enzyme
involved
in
the
use
of
N
-
acetylneuraminate
and
N
-
acetylmannosamine
as
carbon
sources
[
35
]
.

The
differences
between
our
results
and
those
obtained
in
other
in
vivo
studies
can
be
easily
explained
:
while
the
second
SCOTS
experiment
was
conducted
with
animals
suffering
from
chronic
infections
[
10
]
,
a
condition
which
differs
greatly
from
our
field
case
,
the
STM
and
IVET
techniques
do
not
provide
a
"
snap
-
shot
"
of
the
transcriptome
at
a
precise
time
point
during
the
infection
process
.

While
STM
and
IVET
can
theoretically
provide
a
global
overview
of
transcriptomic
events
,
the
experiments
conducted
with
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
are
not
likely
to
have
achieved
this
goal
.

[
15
]
were
likely
not
saturating
.

STM
relies
on
transposon
mutagenesis
,
and
there
are
some
insertional
hot
spots
in
the
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
genome
[
16
]
.

There
were
no
striking
similarities
when
comparing
the
functions
of
differentially
expressed
genes
in
both
studies
.

As
with
Son
et
al
.
,
we
noticed
that
few
of
the
landmark
virulence
genes
in
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
.

Well
-
characterized
iron
acquisition
genes
such
as
those
coding
for
the
hemoglobin
receptor
HgbA
(
despite
the
important
hemorrhage
noticed
in
the
infected
lungs
)
and
the
genes
coding
for
transferrin
binding
proteins
TbpA
and
TbpB
did
no
show
differential
expression
,
nor
did
genes
involved
in
anaerobic
respiration
.

While
in
the
latter
case
it
can
be
argued
that
the
environmental
conditions
encountered
during
the
acute
infection
might
explain
why
differential
expression
of
these
gene
transcripts
was
not
observed
,
it
could
also
be
hypothesized
that
years
of
evolution
of
the
field
strain
in
nature
might
have
led
to
the
loss
of
some
regulatory
mechanisms
that
could
still
be
present
in
well
-
characterized
laboratory
strains
,
thereby
leading
to
the
constitutive
expression
of
some
important
virulence
genes
.

c
)
Down
-
regulated
genes

Not
much
is
known
,
however
,
about
the
regulation
of
these
transcriptional
units
.

This
would
probably
indicate
that
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
has
a
slower
metabolism
and
replication
rate
in
vivo
than
when
it
is
growing
in
a
rich
culture
medium
.

With
regards
to
their
possible
involvement
in
virulence
processes
,
some
genes
that
were
down
-
regulated
were
of
particular
interest
.

The
Fur
transcriptional
regulator
,
which
represses
transcription
of
genes
associated
with
iron
acquisition
[
40
]
,
showed
a
2
.
6
fold
down
-
regulation
in
transcription
.

In
E
.
coli
,
Fur
also
regulates
its
own
level
of
expression
.

Iron
restriction
if
often
thought
to
be
an
important
signal
for
bacteria
,
and
has
often
been
linked
with
the
expression
of
virulence
factors
such
as
toxins
[
42
]
.

Therefore
,
it
would
seem
that
the
in
vivo
environment
towards
the
end
of
the
acute
phase
of
pleuropneumonia
is
not
iron
-
restricted
for
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
.

This
is
not
surprising
considering
that
there
is
extensive
hemorrhage
and
tissue
destruction
,
caused
most
probably
by
the
secretion
of
Apx
toxins
.

However
,
a
few
genes
involved
in
iron
acquisition
,
namely
APL
_
0096
,
APL
_
0668
,
hbpA
and
irp
,
were
up
-
regulated
.

The
role
of
Hfq
,
a
Sm
-
like
protein
,
has
been
investigated
with
greater
interest
over
the
last
decade
since
it
was
shown
that
it
is
involved
in
the
function
of
small
RNAs
(
sRNAs
)
[
45
]
.

Also
of
interest
was
the
down
-
regulation
of
the
cps5b
(
-
2
.
21
fold
)
and
cpxC
(
-
1
.
82
fold
)
genes
,
involved
respectively
in
the
biosynthesis
of
capsular
polysaccharide
and
in
the
export
of
these
polysaccharides
.

Down
-
regulation
of
cpxABC
,
involved
in
capsule
biosynthesis
,
has
also
been
observed
during
planktonic
life
in
liquid
medium
in
contact
with
porcine
lung
epithelial
cells
[
9
]
.

The
down
-
regulation
of
genes
involved
in
capsule
synthesis
could
potentially
lead
to
the
production
of
a
thinner
capsule
on
the
surface
of
bacteria
,
thereby
unmasking
potential
adhesins
.

d
)
Up
-
regulated
genes

Gene
sohB
has
the
highest
observed
fold
change
(
5
.
39x
)
and
codes
for
a
putative
secreted
serine
protease
that
seems
to
be
well
conserved
in
other
pathogenic
bacteria
,
such
as
Haemophilus
parasuis
,
Neisseria
meningitidis
and
N
.
gonorrhoeae
.

In
the
lungs
,
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
causes
extensive
tissue
damage
that
could
result
from
the
combined
action
of
Apx
toxins
and
secreted
proteases
[
48
]
.

Here
,
we
report
that
genes
apfB
and
apfC
,
coding
for
the
type
IV
pilin
biogenesis
proteins
ApfB
and
ApfC
,
were
up
-
regulated
in
vivo
during
natural
infection
by
an
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
isolate
.

Interestingly
,
another
gene
that
could
share
similar
functions
was
also
up
-
regulated
.

APL
_
0220
codes
for
a
member
of
the
CscG
superfamily
of
proteins
involved
in
the
assembly
of
curli
fibers
.

Curli
fibers
are
important
for
biofilm
formation
in
numerous
pathogens
,
including
E
.
coli
and
Salmonella
enteritidis
,
and
are
involved
in
the
first
steps
of
attachment
.

Neither
of
these
two
other
genes
shares
homology
with
known
csc
genes
.

Finally
,
the
kpsF
gene
,
coding
for
an
arabinose
-
5
-
phosphate
isomerase
,
should
also
be
mentioned
since
it
is
involved
in
the
pathway
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
2
-
keto
-
3deozyoctulosonic
acid
(
Kdo
)
,
which
is
present
in
the
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
LPS
core
oligosaccharide
[
52
]
and
capsule
of
serotype
5
[
53
]
.

Studies
in
our
laboratory
have
shown
that
it
is
the
core
oligosaccharide
that
is
responsible
for
the
previously
observed
LPS
-
associated
adhesion
mechanism
[
54
,

]
.

Genes
from
the
maltose
operon
,
involved
in
the
uptake
and
catabolism
of
maltose
[
56
]
,
were
up
-
regulated
:
the
genes
malP
,
malK
,
malF
,
malG
,
malQ
and
a
malM
homolog
(
APL
_
1234
)
were
actively
transcribed
in
the
host
(
average
fold
increase
of
3
.
1
)
,
and
gene
lamB1
,
which
codes
for
a
maltoporin
,
showed
a
5
.
14
fold
change
in
the
only
hybridization
in
which
the
reporter
wasn
'
t
manually
flagged
because
of
signal
saturation
.

It
was
also
recently
shown
that
catabolism
of
maltose
provides
a
competitive
advantage
to
pathogenic
and
commensal
E
.
coli
strains
in
the
gut
[
59
]
.

In
E
.
coli
,
these
genes
are
responsible
for
the
transport
and
utilization
of
ascorbate
in
anaerobic
conditions
[
60
]
.

While
ascorbate
use
has
not
been
linked
to
bacterial
virulence
before
,
it
has
been
shown
on
multiple
occasions
that
genes
involved
in
anaerobic
metabolism
are
important
for
the
virulence
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
[
10
,
61
-
63
]
.

In
pigs
lungs
,
following
extensive
infection
and
tissue
destruction
,
the
bacteria
are
likely
to
face
oxygen
deprivation
.

The
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase
and
fumarate
reductase
subunit
C
,
respectively
encoded
by
genes
pepC
and
frdC
,
are
also
required
during
anaerobic
growth
.

However
,
neither
of
these
changes
were
deemed
statistically
significant
.

This
suggests
that
HlyX
is
probably
not
highly
expressed
during
the
acute
phase
of
the
disease
caused
by
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
.

Two
genes
coding
for
proteins
with
regulatory
functions
were
found
to
be
up
-
regulated
.

The
phoR
gene
codes
for
the
phosphate
regulon
PhoR
sensing
protein
,
located
in
the
inner
membrane
.

In
E
.
coli
,
this
protein
is
part
of
a
two
-
component
regulatory
system
that
responds
to
periplasmic
orthophosphate
concentration
variations
[
65
]
.

Numerous
phoR
,
phoB
(
the
other
component
of
the
two
-
component
system
)
and
pts
(
the
phosphate
transport
genes
genetically
and
functionally
linked
to
phoBR
)
mutants
were
found
to
be
less
virulent
or
avirulent
when
compared
to
wild
-
type
strains
,
with
phenotypes
such
as
increased
sensitivity
to
serum
,
acidity
and
cationic
antimicrobial
peptides
[
66
]
and
reduced
colonization
[
67
]
.

A
.
pleuropneumoniae
strain
L20
harbours
an
operon
composed
of
the
genes
ptsSCAB
-
phoBR
.

Although
only
phoR
was
deemed
significantly
up
-
regulated
,
all
other
genes
showed
levels
of
variations
ranging
from
a
1
.
5
-
to
2
-
fold
increase
.

Since
it
seems
unlikely
that
porcine
lungs
are
devoid
of
phosphate
,
the
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
PhoBR
system
might
be
important
in
order
to
adapt
correctly
to
changing
conditions
inside
the
host
.

However
,
the
L20
cpxA
homolog
seems
to
either
be
truncated
,
or
found
on
two
separate
gene
loci
.

Three
genes
satisfied
those
criteria
:
two
that
are
coding
for
outer
membrane
proteins
(
APL
_
0959
and
irp
)
,
and
one
coding
for
a
lipoprotein
(
APL
_
0920
)
(
see
Additional
file

)
.

The
irp
(
iron
responsive
protein
)
gene
codes
for
a
predicted
TonB
-
dependant
receptor
,
possibly
involved
in
hemin
transport
.

In
Histophilus
somni
,
the
FhaB
homolog
is
thought
to
also
have
an
important
role
in
biofilm
formation
in
cases
of
myocarditis
caused
by
this
micro
-
organism
[
75
]
.

The
three
proteins
that
are
encoded
by
genes
fhaB
,
irp
and
APL
_
0920
have
all
these
features
,
and
might
therefore
represent
good
candidates
to
include
in
future
cross
-
serotype
vaccines
against
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
.

These
vaccines
have
been
successfully
used
to
prevent
whopping
cough
and
have
contributed
to
a
considerable
decrease
in
the
number
of
cases
registered
per
year
[

.

Conclusions

By
comparing
our
results
to
those
obtained
following
comparative
genomics
and
proteomics
experiments
,
we
were
able
to
identify
three
genes
that
were
conserved
in
tested
reference
strains
and
in
fresh
field
isolates
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
,
and
these
were
also
predicted
to
code
for
outer
membrane
proteins
or
lipoproteins
.

While
our
results
can
help
decipher
some
of
the
adaptations
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
has
to
make
once
it
infects
the
host
,
much
more
research
is
necessary
in
order
to
understand
the
whole
picture
of
the
disease
.

The
acute
stage
and
the
chronic
stage
of
the
disease
are
probably
highly
different
conditions
,
and
it
would
be
interesting
in
future
works
to
compare
our
present
data
with
the
transcriptomic
profile
of
A
.
pleuropneumoniae
during
a
chronic
infection
.

Identification
of
the
Regulatory
Logic
Controlling
Salmonella
Pathoadaptation
by
the
SsrA
-
SsrB
Two
-
Component
System

Regulatory
evolution
,
in
which
non
-
coding
DNA
is
mutated
to
create
new
regulatory
nodes
,
also
contributes
to
this
diversity
to
allow
niche
adaptation
and
the
evolution
of
pathogenesis
.

To
survive
in
the
host
environment
,
Salmonella
enterica
uses
a
type
III
secretion
system
and
effector
proteins
,
which
are
activated
by
the
SsrA
-
SsrB
two
-
component
system
in
response
to
the
host
environment
.

To
better
understand
the
phenomenon
of
regulatory
evolution
in
S
.
enterica
,
we
defined
the
SsrB
regulon
and
asked
how
this
transcription
factor
interacts
with
the
cis
-
regulatory
region
of
target
genes
.

Using
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
,
cDNA
hybridization
,
and
comparative
genomics
analyses
,
we
describe
the
SsrB
-
dependent
regulon
of
ancestral
and
horizontally
acquired
genes
.

Further
,
we
used
a
genetic
screen
and
computational
analyses
integrating
experimental
data
from
S
.
enterica
and
sequence
data
from
an
orthologous
regulatory
system
in
the
insect
endosymbiont
,
Sodalis
glossinidius
,
to
identify
the
conserved
yet
flexible
palindrome
sequence
that
defines
DNA
recognition
by
SsrB
.

Mutational
analysis
of
a
representative
promoter
validated
this
palindrome
as
the
minimal
architecture
needed
for
regulatory
input
by
SsrB
.

Silencing
of
horizontally
-
acquired
genes
by
DNA
binding
proteins
like
H
-
NS
is
one
way
some
incoming
genes
are
initially
controlled
[
2
]
,
[
3
]
,
which
can
then
be
subject
to
regulatory
evolution
by
mutating
cis
-
regulatory
operator
regions
to
select
for
optional
gene
expression
.

The
eventual
promoter
architecture
selected
to
deploy
virulence
genes
is
often
modular
and
should
reflect
a
design
that
maximizes
organismal
fitness
while
limiting
fitness
trade
-
offs
and
antagonistic
pleiotropy
[

]
.

SsrA
-
SsrB
is
another
two
-
component
regulatory
system
co
-
inherited
by
genetic
linkage
with
the
SPI
-
2
locus
that
is
essential
for
gene
expression
in
SPI
-
2
[
14
]
-
[
16
]
.

SsrA
is
a
sensor
kinase
activated
in
the
host
environment
that
phosphorylates
the
SsrB
response
regulator
to
create
an
active
transcription
factor
needed
for
spatiotemporal
control
of
virulence
genes
[
13
]
,
[
17
]
.

In
the
Salmonella
genus
,
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island
is
found
only
in
pathogenic
serotypes
of
Salmonella
enterica
that
infect
warm
-
blooded
animals
and
is
absent
from
Salmonella
bongori
,
which
colonizes
cold
-
blooded
animals
[
18
]
.

It
is
generally
accepted
that
SPI
-
2
was
acquired
by
Salmonella
enterica
after
divergence
from
S
.
bongori
,
providing
a
useful
pedigree
to
study
regulatory
evolution
influenced
by
SsrB
.

We
recently
demonstrated
the
evolutionary
significance
of
cis
-
regulatory
mutations
for
pathoadaptation
of
Salmonella
enterica
serovar
Typhimurium
(
S
.
Typhimurium
)
to
an
animal
host
[
19
]
.

Our
focus
was
on
SsrB
because
of
its
broad
conservation
among
the
pathogenic
Salmonellae
and
its
essentiality
for
animal
infection
,
suggesting
it
coordinates
fundamental
aspects
of
Salmonella
pathogenesis
beyond
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
how
regulatory
evolution
assimilates
horizontally
acquired
and
ancestral
genes
into
the
SsrB
regulon
on
a
genome
-
wide
scale
using
an
integrated
set
of
experimental
methods
.

Results

Transcriptional
profiling
of
an
ssrB
mutant
To
begin
to
understand
regulatory
evolution
and
network
expansion
of
the
SsrB
response
regulator
,
we
profiled
the
transcriptome
of
an
ssrB
mutant
and
compared
it
to
S
.

This
included
almost
all
genes
in
the
SPI
-
2
genomic
island
as
well
as
effector
genes
encoded
throughout
the
genome
(
Dataset
S1
)
.

Typhimurium
strain
LT2
[
23
]
.

The
majority
of
functions
in
the
latter
groups
are
in
transport
,
secretion
,
and
trafficking
of
cellular
components
in
addition
to
protein
and
membrane
modification
.

The
SsrA
-
SsrB
system
was
acquired
by
horizontal
gene
transfer
into
the
S
.
enterica
species
after
divergence
from
what
is
now
extant
S
.
bongori
.

As
such
,
S
.
bongori
has
evolved
in
the
absence
of
SsrA
-
SsrB
and
its
regulatory
architecture
has
not
been
influenced
by
it
.

To
expand
on
this
,
we
used
a
reciprocal
BLAST
-
based
analysis
and
identified
47
orthologs
in
S
.
bongori
among
the
133
genes
whose
transcription
was
down
-
regulated
in
an
ssrB
mutant
(
Table

)
.

In
DeltassrB
cells
,
the
mean
fold
-
change
of
the
orthologous
genes
(

)
was
subtler
than
for
the
S
.
enterica
-

gene
set
(

.
2
-
fold
)
,
which
included
the
T3SS
and
associated
effector
genes
(
Dataset

)
.

We
also
determined
the
distribution
of
down
-
regulated
genes
among
genomic
islands
[
24
]
,
including
prophages
,
pathogenicity
islands
(
SPI

)
and
additional
regions
of
difference
(
ROD
)
between
S
.
enterica
and
S
.
bongori
(
Dataset

)
.

For
this
we
used
a
BLAST
-
based
comparison
of
genome
-
wide
synteny
between
S
.

Typhimurium
and
S

bongori
and
identified
50
ROD
that
included
17
previously
reported
SPI

islands
and
prophages
.

Genome
-
wide
SsrB
interactions

To
examine
SsrB
allocation
on
the
chromosome
in
vivo
,
we
isolated
functional
SsrB
-
DNA
interactions
using
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
and
examined
the
bound
DNA
by
chip
analysis
(
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
)
using
an
S
.

With
this
method
,
we
identified
256
significant
interaction
peaks
distributed
throughout
the
genome
that
were
enriched
under
SsrB
-
activating
conditions
and
with
interaction
scores
three
standard
deviations
greater
than
the
mean
probe
score
(
Figure

and
Table

)
.

Typhimurium

.

From
this
analysis
,
62
of
256
SsrB
binding
peaks
(
24
.
3
%
)
occurred
within
genomic
islands
(
Figure
2B
)
.

In
order
to
rigorously
evaluate
our
genome
-
wide
functional
genomics
data
,
we
compared
it
against
traditional
biochemical
experiments
describing
SsrB
-
DNA
interactions
at
the
SPI
-
2
locus
.

Previous
data
reported
SsrB
footprints
upstream
of
6
genes
in
SPI
-
2
:
ssrA
,
ssrB
,
ssaB
,
sseA
,
ssaG
,
and
ssaM
[
25
]
,
[
26
]
.

Our
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
data
showed
discrete
SsrB
binding
at
all
of
these
promoters
except
for
the
promoter
reported
to
be
between
ssrA
and
ssrB
[
25
]
(
Figure

)
.

We
attempted
to
verify
functional
activity
at
this
site
,
but
could
not
using
transcriptional
fusions
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Our
data
also
identified
three
additional
SsrB
binding
peaks
upstream
of
sseA
,
within
the
CDS
of
ssaJ
,
and
in
the
IGR
upstream
of
ssaR
(
Figure

)
.

Functional
interactions
were
confirmed
for
sseA
and
ssaR
in
subsequent
reporter
experiments
described
below
.

Identification
of
a
functional
DNA
element
for
SsrB
binding

We
fused
the
DNA
binding
domain
of
SsrB
(
SsrBc
)
to
the
alpha
-
subunit
of
RNA
polymerase
and
screened
a
prey
library
of
approximately108
DNA
molecules
previously
counter
-
selected
against
self
-
activation
(
Figure
4A
)
.

From
189
unique
sequences
isolated
for
SsrBc
,
over
80
%
contained
a
degenerate
consensus
motif
,
mCCyTA
(
Figure
4B
)
.

In
control
screens
with
the
PhoP
-
alphaNTD
fusion
,
the
PhoP
box
sequence
(
G
/
T
)
GTTTA
was
identified
in
11
%
of
sequenced
preys
(
12
/
109
,
data
not
shown
)
but
this
sequence
was
never
captured
by
SsrB
-
alphaNTD
and
vice
versa
,
demonstrating
specificity
of
the
bacterial
one
-
hybrid
system
for
prokaryotic
regulatory
proteins
.

Next
,
we
examined
our
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
data
for
the
presence
of
a
conserved
regulatory
motif
.

We
extracted
sequence
data
from
the
local
maxima
of
the
256
binding
peaks
and
analyzed
the
sequences
with
the
computational
program
MDscan
[
30
]
.

Using
the
highest
-
ranking
probes
to
generate
an
initial
prediction
followed
by
lower
-
ranking
probes
for
refinement
,
this
analysis
identified
motifs
that
represented
either
the
forward
or
the
reverse
complement
of
the
consensus
sequence
ACmTTA
,
which
shares
consensus
with
the
motif
identified
in
the
bacterial
one
-
hybrid
screen
(
Figure
4B
)
.

We
identified
variations
of
this
motif
within
footprinted
regions
of
SsrB
-
regulated
promoters
[
25
]
,
,
however
sequence
degeneracy
made
it
difficult
to
precisely
map
the
input
functions
.

Interestingly
,
two
copies
of
the

occur
upstream
of
the
ssrA

in

.

In
accord
with
a
previous
observation
[
26

,
there
was
not
a
strict
requirement
in
the
spacing
between
the

the
downstream

and
in

from

suggested
that
regulatory

by
SsrB
was
through
a
palindrome

.

However
,
other
lines
of
evidence
suggested
that
the
recognition

was
flexible
in

:
(

We
chose
the

differing
only

deletion
of
the
entire

lead
to

,
which
was
reduced
to
less

showed

.

Therefore
,
we

generated
from
all

To

this
,
we
created

The
transcriptional
activity
from
a

palindrome
sequence
was
high
,
but
was
completely
abolished
in
an
ssrB
mutant
and
in
experiments
where
only
the
palindrome
sequence
was
precisely
deleted
(
Figure
5D
)
.

These
experiments
demonstrated
a
functional
role
for
the
conserved
palindrome
in
Sodalis
and
the
requirement
for
SsrB
for
transcriptional
activation
.

The
above
results
identified
the
conserved
,
yet
flexible
,
palindrome
sequence
defining
DNA
recognition
by
SsrB
.

To
examine
the
extent
to
which
regulatory
evolution
has
been
selective
for
this
genetic
architecture
,
we
created
a
position
weight
matrix
(
PWM
)
for
the
five
strongest
palindrome
sites
in
SPI
-
2
and
the
orthologous
sites
in
Sodalis
SSR
-

.

We
then
searched
for
representative
candidates
of
this
motif
in
the
S
.

Typhimurium
genome
using
the
simple
scoring
algorithm
MotifLocator
[
45
]
,
[

]
.

This
analysis
recovered
the
motifs
upstream
of
ssaB
,
ssaG
,
ssaM
,
and
ssaR
that
were
used
to
generate
the
PWM
.

We
identified
24
palindromes
co

occurring
with
ChIP

peaks
upstream
of
24
different

Applying
a

to
the

allowed
us
to
identify
two

the

sequence
upstream

the

,
while

refers
to
the
SsrB
-
footprinted
IGR
site
with
only
one
conserved
heptamer
defined
in
Figure

)
.

These
genes
either
lacked
an
upstream
ChIP
peak
above
our
3
-
standard
deviation
cut
-
off
(
sseK
)
or
had
such
a
peak
but
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
in
our
transcriptional
profiling
experiments
(
steA
,
gogB
)
.

Our
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
data
revealed
three
additional
strong
SsrB
binding
peaks
within
SPI
-
2
:
one
in
the
IGR
directly
upstream
of
ssaR
,
a
second
within
the
CDS
for
ssaJ
,
and
a
third
within
the
CDS
for
ssaE
that
would
be
predicted
to
influence
transcription
of
the
downstream
effector
/
chaperone
operon
beginning
with
sseA
.

The
analysis
described
above
recovered
SsrB
palindrome
sequences
at
the
sseA
'
and
ssaR
locations
prompting
further
validation
of
these
sites
.

For
the
IGR
palindrome
upstream
of
ssaR
,
we
tested
both
a
chromosome
-
integrated
transcriptional
fusion
and
an
autonomous
episomal
reporter
.

In
wild
-
type
cells
these
reporters
were
as
active
as
other
SPI
-
2
promoters
,
whereas
promoter
activity
was
abrogated
in
DeltassrB
cells
,
implicating
this
IGR
as
a
functional
promoter
for
ssaR
(
Figure
6B
and
Figure
S4
)
.

We
next
tested
the
function
of
the
intragenic
palindrome
within
ssaE
(
sseA
'
)
.

These
experiments
showed
that
the
sseA
'
sequence
contributes
approximately
75
%
of
transcriptional
output
at
the
sseA
promoter
(
Figure
6C
)
,
since
deleting
the
single
heptamer
in
the
sseA
IGR
had
little
effect
on
transcriptional
output
in
any
of
the
strain
backgrounds
.

These
reporter
data
are
in
line
with
the
respective
binding
scores
for
the
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
interaction
peaks
(
Figure
3
)
and
the
sequence
similarity
for
these
elements
with
respect
to
the
consensus
palindrome
(
Figure
6A
and
Figure
4D
)
.

Together
,
these
data
provide
compelling
evidence
for
the
identity
of
the
DNA
recognition
element
that
has
been
selected
through
evolution
to
co
-
regulate
an
SsrB
-
dependent
gene
program
involved
in
adaptation
to
a
host
.

Discussion

A
good
example
of
this
is
acquisition
of
type
III
secretion
by
mutualists
and
pathogenic
bacteria
enabling
new
colonization
strategies
within
a
host
[
33
]
,
[
34
]
.

This
regulatory
system
was
co
-
acquired
with
a
T3SS
encoded
in
the
SPI
-
2
pathogenicity
island
and
likely
contributed
to
immediate
and
gradual
phenotypic
diversity
as
new
regulatory
nodes
were
explored
and
acted
upon
by
natural
selection
.

Extensive
work
has
been
reported
on
the
characterization
of
SsrB
dependent
genes
,
including
functional
evaluation
of
genes
encoded
within
SPI
-
2
in
addition
to
genome
-
wide
transcriptional
studies
[
14
]
,
[
15
]
.

Direct
profiling
of
SsrB
-
DNA
interactions
using
ChIP
-
on
-
chip
was
used
to
identify
SsrB
binding
sites
in
the
genome
.

In
both
cases
these
input
sites
were
found
to
be
functional
.

As
a
result
of
our
mutational
analyses
we
conclude
that
so
long
as
the
orientation
of
a
single
heptamer
of
the
palindrome
is
conserved
with
respect
to
the
downstream
gene
,
SsrB
is
tolerant
of
degeneracy
in
the
adjacent
spacer
and
heptamer
sequences
.

While
we
were
able
to
identify
a
number
of
limited
palindrome
-
like
sequences
from
our
bacterial
one
-
hybrid
screen
,
this
tolerance
in
addition
to
the
library
size
required
to
pull
out
an
18
-
bp
palindrome
in
large
numbers
may
explain
why
we
isolated
functional
single
heptamer
sequences
and
why
degenerate
palindromes
naturally
exist
in
the
genome
.

Our
findings
also
suggest
that
dimerization
is
likely
required
for
transcriptional
activation
however
strong
recognition
by
one
monomer
may
stabilize
interaction
of
a
second
monomer
with
a
less
than
ideal
sequence
.

The
finding
that
a
flexible
palindromic
sequence
can
be
selective
for
SsrB
input
raises
many
interesting
questions
around
the
nature
of
regulatory
evolution
.

The
ability
to
use
a
short
functional
half
-
site
adjacent
to
an
uncharacterized
threshold
level
of
tolerated
bases
would
reduce
the
period
of
neutral
evolution
required
to
generate
an
inverted
repeat
sequence
twice
the
length
[
37
]
,
and
would
limit
the
loss
of
intermediate
variations
to
drift
while
a
more
desirable
palindrome
is
created
by
regulatory
evolution
.

We
showed
that
the
SsrB
regulatory
palindrome
is
also
present
in
the
orthologous
SSR
-
3
island
of
the
endosymbiont
Sodalis
glossinidius
and
that
the
palindrome
evolved
in
Sodalis
can
act
as
a
cis
regulatory
input
function
in
Salmonella
.

Thus
,
in
addition
to
supporting
a
pathogenic
lifestyle
within
a
host
in
Salmonella
,
it
seems
probable
that
this
common
promoter
architecture
may
direct
the
activation
of
the
SSR
-
3
T3SS
of
S
.
glossinidius
in
its
endosymbiotic
relationship
with
the
tsetse
fly
host
,
although
we
acknowledge
this
requires
experimental
validation
.

The
SSR
-
3
region
in
S
.
glossinidius
is
fully
conserved
in
gene
synteny
and
content
with
that
of
SPI
-
2
[
31
]
,
with
the
exception
of
two
effector
genes
missing
in
SSR
-
3
(
sseF
and
sseG
)
that
are
required
to
localize
vacuolar
Salmonella
to
the
perinuclear
Golgi
in
host
cells
[
38
]
,
[
39
]
.

To
the
contrary
,
high
local
conservation
in
the
promoters
evolved
in
Salmonella
and
Sodalis
was
the
crux
in
defining
the
functional
SsrB
input
among
stochastic
noise
.

This
analysis
revealed
strong
palindrome
sequence
conservation
in
five
promoters
identified
in
SPI
-
2
and
in
the
orthologous
sequences
in
Sodalis
SSR
-
3
.

Among
palindrome
-
containing
promoters
,
the
ssrA
promoter
is
exceptional
for
two
reasons
:
a
lack
of
conservation
between
Salmonella
and
Sodalis
,
and
the
evolution
of
tandem
palindromes
in
Salmonella
.

One
possible
interpretation
of
this
divergent
regulatory
architecture
in
front
of
ssrA
might
relate
to
bacterial
lifestyle
.

The
endosymbiotic
relationship
of
Sodalis
with
the
tsetse
fly
-
where
long
-
term
vertical
transmission
has
ostensibly
been
formative
in
shaping
regulatory
circuitry
at
certain
promoters
-
may
obviate
the
need
for
rapid
transcriptional
surge
,
leading
to
regulatory
drift
or
selection
against
positive
feedback
.

Introduction

Group
A
streptococci
(
GAS
)
are
human
pathogens
that
infect
over
700
million
children
and
adults
each
year
[
1
]
.

Among
the
various
GAS
serotypes
,
the
globally
disseminated
M1T1
clonal
strain
remains
the
most
frequently
isolated
from
cases
of
invasive
and
non
-
invasive
infections
[
2
]
,
[
3
]
,
and
although
disease
severity
partially
depends
on
host
genetic
factors
[
4
]
,
[
5
]
,
[
6
]
,
M1T1
GAS
possesses
unique
genomic
features
that
contribute
to
its
evolutionary
fitness
[
7
]
,
[
8
]
,
[
9
]
,
[
10
]
.

Among
these
features
is
the
ability
of
M1T1
bacteria
to
switch
to
a
hypervirulent
phenotype
associated
with
invasive
diseases
in
vivo
[
11
]
,
[
12
]
,
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
,
a
phenomenon
that
is
not
fully
understood
and
whose
specificity
to
the
M1
serotype
remains
to
be
established
[
15
]
.

We
previously
reported
that
virulent
representatives
of
M1T1
GAS
,
with
the
phenotype
SpeBhi
/
SpeA
-
/
Sda1low
,
irreversibly
switch
to
the
hypervirulent
SpeB
-
/
SpeA
+
/
Sda1high
phenotype
after
>
/
=
3
days
in
vivo
[
12
]
,
[
16
]
and
that
the
parent
phenotype
vanishes
by
day
7
post
-
infection
[
16
]
.

CovR
regulatory
activity
is
thought
to
be
triggered
when
the
protein
is
phosphorylated
at
D53
[
21
]
,
possibly
by
acetyl
phosphate
[
22
]
,
[
23
]
.

This
complexity
is
further
magnified
by
the
reported
strain
-
specific
differences
in
the
impact
of
CovS
on
pathogenesis
[
24
]
,
by
the
finding
that
phosphorylated
CovR
has
different
affinities
to
different
streptococcal
promoters
[
21
]
,
and
by
the
possibility
that
CovR
promoter
binding
may
be
modulated
by
kinases
or
phosphatases
other
than
CovS
[
25
]
.

In
accordance
with
these
biochemical
findings
,
we
and
others
have
reported
that
some
covS
mutations
generate
hypervirulent
isolates
associated
with
invasive
forms
of
streptococcal
infection
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
,
[
26
]
,
[
28
]
.

One
of
the
most
striking
outcomes
of
these
mutations
is
the
constitutive
repression
of
a
gene
encoding
the
key
GAS
cysteine
protease
,
SpeB
,
which
remodels
the
host
-
pathogen
interface
[
29
]
by
differentially
degrading
bacterial
surface
and
secreted
proteins
[
12
]
,
[
30
]
,
[
31
]
as
well
as
host
proteins
[
32
]
,
[
33
]
,
[
34
]
.

One
of
these
preserved
factors
is
the
highly
potent
DNase
,
Sda1
,
which
destroys
neutrophil
extracellular
traps
,
NETs
[
36
]
,
protecting
the
bacteria
from
neutrophil
killing
,
promoting
bacterial
invasion
,
and
facilitating
human
plasminogen
-
mediated
bacterial
dissemination
into
normally
sterile
sites
,
which
results
in
invasive
infections
[
14
]
.

Despite
the
association
between
covS
mutations
and
the
emergence
of
the
hypervirulent
phenotype
of
M1T1
strains
,
it
is
unclear
whether
this
increased
virulence
can
be
entirely
attributed
to
the
modulation
of
the
CovR
regulon
or
if
other
networks
are
also
perturbed
in
vivo
directly
,
indirectly
,
or
independently
of
the
CovRS
system
.

To
address
these
issues
and
improve
our
understanding
of
the
gene
regulatory
impact
of
mutational
and
adaptive
events
contributing
to
the
hypervirulent
phenotype
of
M1T1
strains
,
we
analyzed
differences
in
growth
requirements
,
transcriptome
profiles
,
and
regulatory
circuits
of
the
virulent
(
WT
)
and
hypervirulent
(
AP
)
phenotypes
of
the
M1T1
strain
both
in
vitro
and
during
initial
in
vivo
infection
.

Such
comprehensive
analyses
highlighted
the
behavior
of
genomic
subsystems
that
may
be
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
S
.
pyogenes
niche
adaptation
and
pathogenesis
.

For
example
,
AP
bacteria
grew
better
than
WT
bacteria
in
the
presence
of
N
-
acetyl
-
neuraminic
acid
,
and
were
more
sensitive
to
four
antimicrobials
(
out
of
373
screened
in
PM
)
,
including
the
calcium
-
specific
metal
chelator
EGTA
,
the
lipophilic
chelator
5
-
chloro
-
7
-
iodo
-
8
-
hydroxyquinoline
,
and
the
antibiotics
tobramycin
and
cefotaxime
(
Table
1
)
.

Minimal
media
are
not
optimal
for
the
expression
of
GAS
proteins
,
which
may
explain
why
GAS
failed
to
grow
at
many
of
the
PM
conditions
(
Fig
.
S1
)
and
why
fewer
phenotypic
differences
were
observed
between
WT
and
AP
bacteria
than
transcriptomic
differences
(
see
below
)
.

Because
bacteria
recovered
from
animals
and
cultured
in

In
this

,
we
designed
and
performed
in

passage
experiments
in
which
equal
loads
of
in

WT

AP
bacteria
were
separately
inoculated
into
murine

[

]
and
collected
by
needle
aspiration
after
24
h
,
a
time
sufficient
for
the
bacteria
to
sense
the
host
environment
and
transcriptionally
respond
to
it
,
but
not
long
enough
to
allow
detectable
restructuring
of
the
bacterial
community
and

of
mutants
.

The
concentrations
of
viable

and

at

remained
essentially

For

we
followed

performed

and

Multiple
approaches
to
microarray
analysis
show
statistically
significant
and
biologically
relevant
differences
between
the
WT
and
AP
populations
in

and
in

To
gain
biologically
relevant
knowledge
from
the
transcriptome
studies
without
compromising
statistical
significance
,
we
interrogated
the
data
using
multiple
strategies
that
had
been
developed
for
microarray
analysis
and
visualization
,
taking
into
consideration
the
strengths
and
limitations
of
each
strategy
.

This
pathovivogram
highlights
the
transcriptional
patterns
that
distinguish
WT
from

regardless
of
their

(

,
and
the
transcriptional

that
are
shared
by
WT

but
that
differentiate
them
from
their
corresponding

(

.

The

describe
those
gene
sets
whose
transcription
was
turned
on
(

)
or
off
(
CC3
)
to
drive
the
bacterial
adaptation
to
the
host
environment
,
but
are
not
primarily
related
to
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

Such
transition
is
bound
to
have
major
downstream
effects
on
the
bacterial
virulence
gene
expression
[

,
[

.

While

match
the
previously

)
,
the
combined
comparative
analysis
of
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
samples
revealed
novel
expression
patterns
exemplified
by
CC6
and
CC10
.

For
example
,
the
expression
of
genes
in
the
SLS
and
Trx
operons
is
induced
in
vivo
only
in
WT
bacteria
,
but
is
mostly
repressed
in
AP
bacteria
(
Fig
.
2
,
CC6
)
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Likewise
,
some
genes
are
only
induced
in
AP
-
vivo
,
including
those
encoding
the
toxin
/
enzyme
streptokinase
and
a
RofA
/
Nra
-
like
transcriptional
regulator
(
Fig
.

,
CC10
)
.

Subsequent
to
the
coexpression
analysis
,
we
calculated
differential
expression
ratios
between
each
pair
of
conditions
(
Table
S2
)
at
different
statistical
significance
cutoffs
,
starting
by
the
commonly
used
significance
threshold
of
twofold
ratio
and
P
value
<
0
.
05
,
and
moving
to
thresholds
that
are
more
conservative
.

At
all
significance
cutoffs
,
the
fewest
observed
transcriptional
changes
were
those
differentiating
WT
and
AP
bacteria
in
vitro
compared
to
other
pairs
of
conditions
.

Overall
,
at
the
least
conservative
statistical
threshold
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
,
the
transcription
of
557
(
23
.
9
%
)
out
of
2
,
329
genes
probed
in
the
microarrays
was
significantly
perturbed
(
up
or
down
,
at
one
or
more
conditions
,
Fig
.
S3
)
and
the
only
set
of
contiguous
genes
that
underwent
transcriptional
changes
at
all
tested
conditions
is
the
SpeB
operon
gene
set
(
CC4
in
Fig
.
2
)
.

Inspired
by
the
recently
described
neighbor
clustering
method
for
microarray
analysis
[
41
]
,
we
also
mapped
the
significant
(
P
<
0
.
05
)
differential
expression
ratios
of
different
genes
to
their
chromosomal
loci
(
Fig
.
3
and
Fig
.
S4
)
to
allow
the
visualization
of
coexpressed
contiguous
genes
,
including
operons
.

This
mapping
highlighted
genes
that
might
otherwise
have
been
overlooked
by
the
CC
or
expression
ratio
methods
.

A
subsystem
is
a
part
of
a
genome
that
represents
a
functional
module
,
e
.
g
.
,
an
operon
,
a
cellular
pathway
,
a
regulon
,
or
a
complex
regulatory
network
[
43
]
.

Of
interest
,
among
the
genes
of
known
function
,
25
%
of
those
whose
transcription
was
modulated
as
a
consequence
of
the
covS
mutation
are
virulence
-
related
and
another
25
%
are
related
to
carbohydrate
metabolism
pathways
,
which
are
connected
to
virulence
in
streptococci
[
44
]
,
[
45
]
,
[
46
]
.

When
we
attempted
to
correlate
the
array
results
with
known
GAS
regulons
,
some
differentially
expressed
gene
sets
could
be
fitted
into
previously
described
regulatory
networks
while
others
did
not
belong
to
any
such
networks
.

Alternatively
,
the
mutation
in
covS
may
have
different
effects
on
CovR
-
mediated
regulation
of
different
genes
[
26
]
.

In
fact
,
our
in
vivo
data
show
that
covR
itself
is
downregulated
in
vivo
in
both
WT
and
AP
strains
(
Fig
.
2
,
CC2
and
Table
S1
)
;
however
,
the
SLS
operon
is
upregulated
in
vivo
in
WT
bacteria
,
suggesting
that
its
regulation
is
not
solely
modulated
by
CovRS
.

The
TrxRS
system
reportedly
responds
to
a
yet
-
to
-
be
-
identified
extracellular
signal
while
TrxR
itself
is
directly
regulated
by
CovR
[
42
]
.

Inactivation
or
downregulation
of
one
regulator
may
eventually
perturb
the
entire
system
,
and
several
other
regulators
are
likely
to
become
engaged
in
compensatory
mechanisms
to
maintain
cellular
homeostasis
.

Discussion

Normally
,
capturing
such
evolutionary
events
in
real
time
is
difficult
,
both
because
multiple
sampling
of
the
bacteria
in
vivo
is
often
unfeasible
due
to
their
dissemination
,
and
because
the
fittest
members
of
the
community
usually
overtake
the
rest
of
the
population
rather
rapidly
,
thereby
hampering
the
ability
to
capture
dynamic
changes
associated
with
the
restructuring
of
the
bacterial
community
at
different
host
niches
.

In
vitro
,
the
growth
of
these
two
variants
of
the
M1T1
bacteria
was
comparable
and
,
although
137
(
5
.
9
%
)
of
their
genes
were
differentially
expressed
(
Table
2
)
,
in
vitro
phenotypic
screening
revealed
negligible
differences
(
Table
1
)
.

Indeed
,
several
virulence
genes
were
among
the
137
in
vitro
differentially
expressed
genes
between
these
two
M1T1
variants
.

Besides
metabolic
gene
sets
involved
in
trehalose
and
ascorbate
utilization
,
several
known
virulence
factors
were
downregulated
in
AP
bacteria
,
and
these
included
the
SpeB
operon
,
GRAB
,
EndoS
,
and
CAMP
factor
.

SpeB
is
a
major
virulence
factor
in
GAS
pathogenesis
and
its
expression
is
regulated
by
different
systems
[
40
]
,
[
56
]
,
[
57
]
,
[
58
]
,
including
the
CovRS
system
[
20
]
,
[
53
]
.

Their
downregulation
in
AP
is
thus
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
this
hypervirulent
variant
is
adapted
for
deep
infection
.

In
addition
,
the
downregulation
of
SpeB
,
EndoS
,
and
CAMP
is
in
agreement
with
our
previous
proteomic
results
[
12
]
as
well
as
other
published
transcriptional
analyses
[
13
]
,
[
27
]
.

As
both
bacterial
variants
were
subjected
to
the
host
environment
,
they
underwent
additional
changes
in
gene
expression
.

By
parsing
these
differentially
expressed
genes
into
operons
,
subsystems
,
and
functional
pathways
,
we
found
that
many
reflect
the
engagement
of
several
regulatory
networks
involved
in
metabolic
adaptation
and
immune
camouflage
or
evasion
of
host
defenses
.

Many
of
the
in
vivo
changes
that
both
the
WT
and
AP
bacteria
underwent
are
suggestive
of
major
metabolic
reprogramming
associated
with
the
transition
from
a
saprophytic
lifestyle
in
the
carbohydrate
-
rich
laboratory
culture
medium
to
a
parasitic
lifestyle
in
the
vascularized
and
the
anaerobic
subcutaneous
environments
rich
in
peptides
,
amino
acids
,
nucleotides
,
and
different
types
of
complex
carbohydrates
.

The
downregulation
of
arginine
deiminase
,
a
streptococcal
immunogen
and
a
potential
vaccine
target
(
Henningham
et
al
.
,
submitted
)
,
is
also
suggestive
of
immune
evasion
.

Several
phage
genes
are
split
between
the
upregulated
and
downregulated
gene
clusters
;
this
may
indicate
a
stress
-
dependent
reprogramming
of
prophage
induction
and
gene
expression
that
needs
to
be
explored
in
future
studies
.

On
the
other
hand
,
genes
encoding
the
fibrinolytic
enzyme
streptokinase
,
Ska
,
a
RofA
-
like
transcriptional
regulator
,
several
cell
division
proteins
,
and
some
phage
proteins
were
only
upregulated
when
the
AP
bacteria
sensed
the
in
vivo
environment
(
AP
-
vivo
,
Fig
.
2
,
CC10
)
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
demonstrate
how
the
murine
model
has
allowed
us
to
finely
dissect
two
classes
of
events
affecting
GAS
sociomicrobiology
:
those
related
to
reversible
transcriptional
adaptation
and
those
irreversibly
caused
by
the
covS
mutation
in
AP
bacteria
.

Comparing
the
microarray
data
in
this
study
with
previously
published
work
provides
further
validation
of
these
results
.

For
example
,
the
in
vitro
microarray
results
are
consistent
with
our
previous
proteomic
studies
of
the
WT
and
AP
secreted
bacterial
proteomes
[
12
]
as
well
as
with
other
recently
published
studies
of
the
in
vitro
transcriptome
of
closely
related
strains
[
13
]
,
[
26
]
,
[
27
]
.

It
also
allowed
us
to
dissect
changes
related
to
niche
adaptation
from
those
reflecting
the
selection
of
the
fittest
members
of
the
bacterial
community
when
faced
with
different
environments
and
conditions
.

The
use
of
multiple
microarray
analysis
strategies
and
the
integration
of
their
results
strengthened
this
study
since
each
strategy
has
advantages
and
disadvantages
.

For
example
,
coexpression
clustering
-
one
of
the
earliest
developed
microarray
analysis
tools
[
62
]
,
[
63
]
-
provides
an
overall
view
of
expression
patterns
of
different
genes
,
and
greatly
helps
dissect
and
demonstrate
the
effect
of
each
condition
on
the
overall
transcriptome
.

Besides
these
two
clustering
methods
,
expression
ratios
provided
pairwise
comparison
,
thereby
allowing
the
quantification
of
the
impact
of
each
individual
change
of
condition
on
overall
gene
expression
(
Table
2
)
as
well
as
on
specific
genes
of
interest
(
Table
3
)
.

However
,
the
use
of
ratios
alone
may
be
misleading
,
especially
when
they
are
calculated
between
two
transcripts
with
low
expression
levels
,
resulting
in
spurious
ratios
of
low
biological
significance
.

The
bigger
picture
:
niche
adaptation
and
the
evolution
of
hypervirulence
in
S
.
pyogenes

However
,
many
of
the
genes
modulated
in
vivo
seem
to
be
involved
in
metabolic
reprogramming
and
stress
responses
rather
than
pathoadaptation
and
virulence
.

This
is
why
we
believe
that
transcriptional
reprogramming
by
environmental
adaptation
alone
was
insufficient
to
provide
WT
bacteria
with
an
in
vivo
survival
advantage
.

However
,
the
degree
of
AP
invasiveness
might
vary
depending
on
the
route
of
infection
and
animal
model
[
15
]
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
SpeB
expression
has
a
dominant
effect
,
since
even
if
secreted
in
low
amounts
by
a
minor
subpopulation
,
this
broad
-
spectrum
protease
would
still
be
able
to
degrade
,
fully
or
partially
,
many
GAS
virulence
proteins
,
including
Sda1
,
thereby
rendering
the
bacteria
vulnerable
to
different
effector
mechanisms
of
the
host
'
s
innate
immune
system
including
neutrophil
killing
[
14
]
,
[
67
]
,
[
68
]
.

Thus
,
a
complete
shutdown
of
proteolytically
active
SpeB
is
essential
to
preserve
effective
extracellular
virulence
factors
[
15
]
.

However
,
the
CovRS
system
is
a
major
player
,
among
these
regulators
,
in
driving
the
bacterial
adaptation
to
the
host
'
s
environment
and
regulating
virulence
directly
or
through
other
downstream
regulators
[
20
]
,
[
54
]
.

It
is
thus
counterintuitive
that
bacteria
lacking
the
important
environmental
sensor
,
CovS
,
would
prevail
in
one
of
the
most
stressful
environments
.

However
,
losing
this
sensor
might
be
the
last
resort
for
these
bacteria
stranded
away
from
their
primary
niche
and
surrounded
by
hostile
immune
cells
and
proteins
.

Such
mutation
is
likely
detrimental
to
the
bacterial
long
-
term
survival
and
dissemination
via
colonization
of
new
hosts
[
71
]
,
as
they
need
a
WT
sensor
for
better
adaptability
[
72
]
(
e
.
g
.
,
in
less
hostile
niches
like
throat
or
saliva
[
26
]
)
.

An
intact
CovRS
system
would
offer
the
bacteria
enough
versatility
to
turn
on
and
off
many
regulatory
networks
through
CovS
signaling
.

(
4
)
We
also
show
that
the
impact
of
the
covS
mutation
goes
beyond
the
defined
CovR
regulon
.

This
finding
is
in
accordance
with
previous
observations
that
CovR
and
CovS
are
not
committed
to
each
other
,
as
CovR
could
be
phosphorylated
in
the
absence
of
a
functional
CovS
[
22
]
and
as
different
covS
mutations
,
albeit
clustered
in
the
histidine
kinase
domain
,
might
have
different
transcriptional
effects
[
27
]
,
including
opposite
effects
on
different
members
of
the
CovR
regulon
[
26
]
.

We
believe
that
our
results
offer
a
proof
of
principle
that
in
vivo
-
extracted
RNA
can
provide
transcriptional
profiles
that
better
reflect
the
complexity
of
heterogeneous
bacterial
communities
,
and
,
as
shown
in
this
study
,
can
provide
a
transcriptional
snapshot
of
a
bacterial
population
right
before
its
extinction
.

The
use
of
in
vivo
-
driven
RNA
in
understanding
virulence
has
been
appreciated
in
streptococcal
research
[
73
]
,
but
the
technique
has
not
previously
been
used
to
explain
the
switch
to
hypervirulent
,
invasive
phenotypes
or
to
dissect
heterogeneous
microbial
subpopulations
.

This
study
is
a
first
step
towards
exploring
the
sociomicrobiology
of
invasive
GAS
in
vivo
.

Having
captured
snapshots
of
different
transcriptional
programs
within
the
same
bacterial
community
,
we
plan
to
follow
with
single
cell
studies
[
74
]
,
[
75
]
of
bacteria
associated
with
immune
cells
to
further
dissect
the
different
roles
played
by
members
of
the
same
bacterial
community

Principal
Findings
In
this
study
,
the
sak188
and
sak189
genes
were
inactivated
,
and
the
functional
role
of
Sak188
/
Sak189
two
-
component
system
in
regulation
of
the
beta
-
antigen
expression
was
investigated
.

It
was
demonstrated
that
both
transcription
of
bac
gene
and
expression
of
encoded
beta
-
antigen
were
controlled
by
Sak189
response
regulator
,
but
not
Sak188
histidine
kinase
.

It
was
also
found
that
the
regulation
occurred
at
transcriptional
level
.

Conclusions
/
Significance
Sak189
response
regulator
is
necessary
for
activation
of
bac
gene
transcription
.

Given
that
the
primary
functional
role
of
Sak188
/
Sak189
two
-
component
systems
is
a
control
of
bac
gene
transcription
,
this
system
can
be
annotated
as
BgrR
/
S
(
bac
gene
regulatory
system
)
.

Introduction

Streptococcus
agalactiae
(
group
B
streptococcus
)
is
an
important
cause
of
neonatal
invasive
infections
and
variety
of
diseases
in
human
and
animals
[
1
]
,
[
2
]
.

One
mechanism
for
adaptation
to
changing
environment
is
transcriptional
regulation
by
two
-
component
regulatory
systems
(
TCSs
)
,
a
family
of
systems
that
are
widely
distributed
among
many
bacterial
genera
[
3
]
.

These
regulatory
systems
comprise
two
proteins
,
sensor
histidine
kinase
,
HK
,
and
DNA
-
binding
response
regulator
,
RR
.

HK
is
a
sensor
protein
,
responding
to
the
environmental
changes
by
autophosphorylating
a
conserved
histidine
residue
.

Conformationally
modified
RR
molecule
functions
as
transcriptional
regulator
(
activator
or
repressor
)
by
binding
with
promoter
regions
of
the
genes
through
helix
-
turn
-
helix
(
HTH
)
motif
.

For
example
,
20
TCSs
have
been
identified
after
the
complete
genome
sequencing
in
the
strain
NEM316
[
6
]
,
and
17
TCSs
-
in
the
strain
2603
V
/
R
[
7
]
.

Inactivation
of
CovRS
was
also
observed
at
phenotypic
level
:
the
mutant
strains
became
less
virulent
compared
to
the
parental
wild
-
type
strain
[
9
]
.

Transcriptome
analysis
revealed
the
CovRS
core
-
regulon
which
consisted
of
39
genes
including
genes
of
the
stress
response
,
the
genes
important
for
adhesion
of
S
.
agalactiae
to
the
host
cells
and
others
[
10
]
.

In
addition
,
inactivation
of
histidine
kinase
gene
rgfC
resulted
in
increased
transcription
of
scpB
gene
[
12
]
.

Recently
,
putative
two
-
component
regulatory
system
genes
encoding
for
sensor
histidine
kinase
(
sak188
)
and
DNA
-
binding
response
regulator
(
sak189
)
were
identified
in
S
.
agalactiae
strains
98
-
D60C
and
A909
[
13
]
,
[
14
]
.

This
surface
protein
has
capacity
to
bind
IgA
and
factor
H
of
complement
,
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
an
important
virulence
factor
[
15
]
.

Sak188
and
Sak189
proteins
revealed
78
%
and
83
%
similarity
with
sensor
histidine
kinase
HK06
and
DNA
-
binding
response
regulator
RR06
of
S
.
pneumoniae
strains
,
respectively
[
13
]
,
[
16
]
-
[
19
]
.

In
S
.
pneumoniae
genome
,
the
hk06
and
rr06
genes
are
adjacent
to
cbpA
gene
encoding
choline
binding
protein
,
CbpA
,
a
surface
-
exposed
protective
antigen
and
virulence
factor
of
S
.
pneumoniae
[
20
]
,
[
21
]
.

In
addition
,
some
regions
of
CbpA
protein
has
the
certain
similarity
with
beta
-
antigen
.

Given
the
certain
similarity
in
the
sequences
,
functions
and
relative
locations
of
Sak188
/
Sak189
and
HK06
/
RR06
,
and
beta
-
antigen
and
CbpA
,
we
suggested
that
Sak188
/
Sak189
TCS
affected
beta
-
antigen
expression
and
virulent
properties
of
S
.
agalactiae
in
the
same
manner
as
HK06
/
RR06
affected
CbpA
in
S
.
pneumoniae
.

A
total

isolated
from
human
and
animals
were
studied
.

They
were
selected
for
further
study
.

PCR
analysis
of
the

revealed
that
the

of

correlated
with
the

of

Construction
and
characterization
of
mutant
strains

To
investigate
a
functional
role
of
the
two
-
component
regulatory
system
Sak188
/
Sak189
in
S
.
agalactiae
,
the
sak188
and
sak189
genes
were
inactivated
by
insertional
mutagenesis
(
Fig
.
2
)
.

PCR
products
were
cloned
into
pGEM
-
T
Easy
vector
(
Promega
,
USA
)
,
and
the
recombinant
plasmids
named
as
pGEM
-
Tsak188
and
pGEM
-
Tsak189
were
digested
with
EcoRI
.

Subsequently
,
EcoRI
fragments
were
cloned
into
suicide
vector
pVA891
-
2
,
and
the
recombinant
plasmids
named
as
pHK
and
pRR
,
respectively
,
were
used
to
transform
S
.
agalactiae
strain
168
/
00
according
to
the
protocol
[
33
]
.

Construction
of
the
strains
was
confirmed
by
PCR
and
nucleotide
sequencing
(
data
not
shown
)
.

The
size
,
shape
and
color
of
the
colonies
,
diameter
of
zone
of
hemolysis
,
morphology
of
the
cells
and
the
chain
length
were
similar
in
all
the
strains
.

At
the
same
time
the
growth
curves
of
mutant
strains
in
THB
slightly
differed
from
the
growth
curve
of
the
strain
168
/
00
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Two
time
points
(
2
hrs
and
5
hrs
)
corresponding
to
the
middle
-
exponential
and
post
-
exponential
phases
of
growth
,
respectively
,
were
selected
for
further
study
.

Effect
of
insertional
inactivation
on
expression
of
beta
-
antigen

Several
approaches
were
used
to
prepare
the
cell
lysates
of
the
wild
-
type
strain
168
/
00
and
mutant
strains
.

As
result
,
10
min
boiling
of
the
cells
in
2
-
mercaptoethanol
(
10
%
,
w
/
w
)
was
found
to
be
most
effective
with
respect
to
higher
yield
and
quality
of
the
protein
bands
observed
after
SDS
-
PAGE
(
data
not
shown
)
.

SDS
-
PAGE
of
secreted
proteins
did
not
reveal
any
difference
among
the
wild
-
type
strain
and
mutant
strains
(
data
not
shown
)
.

Western
-
blotting
with
labeled
human
IgA
identified
this
protein
as
beta
-
antigen
(
Fig
.

)
.

Effect
of
insertional
inactivation
on
transcription
of
bac
gene

As
result
,
transcription
of
bac
gene
in
sak189
/
sak188
double
mutant
strain
was
17
-
fold
less
than
in
168
/
00
wild
-
type
strain
(
Fig
.
3
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
bac
gene
transcription
level
in
sak188
mutant
strain
was
almost
similar
to
that
in
the
wild
-
type
strain
that
confirmed
the
results
of
SDS
-
PAGE
and
western
-
blotting
.

Murine
intraperitoneal
model
of
streptococcal
infection
was
developed
to
compare
the
virulent
properties
of
the
strains
under
study
.

Mice
were
injected
with
0
.
5
ml
of
PBS
containing
108
CFUs
and
observed
for
10
days
.

As
seen
from
the
Fig
.

In
S
.
agalactiae
,
a
total
of
21
TCSs
are
involved
in
the
regulatory
network
essential
for
successful
colonization
,
penetration
and
/
or
invasion
as
well
as
for
resistance
to
human
immune
system
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
functional
role
of
Sak188
/
Sak189
two
-
component
system
in
regulation
of
the
expression
of
beta
-
antigen
,
an
important
virulence
factor
of
S
.
agalactiae
.

It
was
also
found
that
regulation
occurred
at
transcriptional
level
.

Variety
of
publications
are
currently
available
regarding
the
occurrence
of
bac
gene
among
S
.
agalactiae
strains
as
well
as
genetic
polymorphism
of
bac
gene
and
use
of
encoded
beta
-
antigen
as
a
vaccine
component
[
32
]
,
[
34
]
-
[
38
]
.

However
,
the
regulatory
mechanism
of
bac
gene
expression
has
not
been
studied
.

Comparative
analysis
of
Sak188
and
Sak189
amino
acid
sequences
in
the
wild
-
type
strain
168
/
00
and
deduced
protein
sequences
in
mutant
strains
predicted
the
replacement
of
95
amino
acids
at
the
C
-
terminal
end
of
Sak188
protein
by
191
amino
acids
,
and
replacement
of
51
amino
acids
at
the
C
-
terminal
end
of
Sak189
protein
by
15
amino
acids
(
Fig
.
5
)
.

Theoretically
,
in
both
sak188
mutant
strain
and
sak189
/
sak188
double
mutant
strain
,
the
Sak188
/
Sak189
TCS
can
be
inactive
.

In
S
.
pneumoniae
,
inactivation
of
the
response
regulator
RR06
(
83
%
similarity
with
Sak189
)
,
which
binds
promoter
region
of
cbpA
,
repressed
transcription
of
the
cbpA
gene
[
22
]
.

In
this
study
,
western
blotting
and
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
revealed
that
DNA
-
binding
response
regulator
Sak189
is
necessary
for
beta
-
antigen
expression
suggesting
direct
binding
of
Sak189
with
bac
gene
promoter
.

This
is
not
surprising
given
the
high
similarity
in
the
sequences
,
functions
and
relative
locations
of
Sak188
/
Sak189
and
HK06
/
RR06
,
and
beta
-
antigen
and
CbpA
(
Fig
.
1
)
.

In
this
study
,
both
sak188
and
bac
genes
located
downstream
the
sak189
gene
(
Fig
.
1
)
.

Thus
,
we
can
conclude
that
sak188
and
bac
gene
are
not
in
the
operon
,
and
repression
of
bac
gene
transcription
in
sak189
/
sak188
double
mutant
strain
is
not
due
to
the
polar
effect
.

The
cross
-
talk
among
different
TCSs
has
been
described
for
many
bacterial
species
[
3
]
including
pathogenic
streptococci
.

For
example
,
in
S
.
pneumoniae
inactivation
of
histidine
kinase
HK06
(
78
%
similarity
with
Sak188
)
,
in
contrast
to
RR06
(
83
%
similarity
with
Sak189
)
,
did
not
repress
transcription
of
the
adjacent
cbpA
gene
[
22
]
indicating
a
cross
-
talk
between
RR06
and
noncognate
histidine
kinase
(
s
)
.

Intraperitoneal
infection
of
laboratory
mice
demonstrated
that
Sak189
DNA
-
binding
response
regulatory
protein
is
important
for
virulent
properties
of
S
.
agalactiae
.

It
could
be
predicted
given
that
inactivation
of
other
S
.
agalactiae
TCSs
(
CovS
/
CovR
,
DltR
/
DltS
,
RgfA
/
RgfC
)
resulted
in
the
changes
of
virulent
properties
,
however
,
in
all
these
studies
the
mutant
strains
became
less
virulent
compared
to
the
wild
-
type
strains
[
8
]
-
[
12
]
.

Thus
,
we
suggest
that
beta
-
antigen
located
on
the
bacterial
surface
can
interfere
with
the
disease
process
and
play
a
role
of
anti
-
virulent
factor
(
at
least
,
in
mice
)
similarly
to
hyaluronate
lyase
of
S
.
pyogenes
[
41
]
.

It
is
also
possible
that
bac
gene
encoding
for
beta
-
antigen
is
not
only
target
for
Sak188
/
Sak189
TCS
.

The
difference
among
the
growth
curves
of
the
wild
-
type
and
mutant
strains
(
data
not
shown
)
indicate
that
in
addition
to
bac
gene
,
some
metabolic
genes
can
be
controlled
by
Sak188
/
Sak189
TCS
.

This
suggestion
is
confirmed
by
the
numerous
studies
demonstrating
the
genome
-
wide
location
of
the
genes
affected
by
TCSs
[
10
]
,
[
42
]
,
[
43
]
,
and
set
of
the
genes
controlled
by
Sak188
/
Sak189
(
TCS
regulon
)
can
be
identified
using
microarray
technology
.

As
seen
from
the
data
of
this
study
,
transcription
of
bac
gene
and
expression
of
encoded
beta
-
antigen
are
the
primary
genotypic
/
phenotypic
properties
controlled
by
Sak188
/
Sak189
TCS
.

Therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
to
annotate
this
system
as
BgrR
/
S
(
bac
gene
regulatory
system
)
,
and
DNA
-
binding
response
regulator
Sak189
and
sensor
histidine
kinase
Sak188
as
BgrR
and
BgrS
proteins
,
respectively
.

In
conclusion
,
the
data
presented
here
characterize
the
functional
role
of
S
.
agalactiae
Sak188
/
Sak189
two
-
component
system
.

Inactivation
of
histidine
kinase
Sak188
does
not
affect
transcription
of
bac
gene
and
expression
of
beta
-
antigen
,
that
suggests
the
cross
-
talk
between
Sak189
and
other
sensor
kinase
(
s
)
in
S
.
agalactiae
.

Finally
,
Sak189
,
but
not
Sak188
,
controls
virulent
properties
of
S
.
agalactiae
in
vivo
.
