ou had a task of named entity recognition (NER) on biomedical texts and I build a model using BiLSTM + CNN.
I created a class for the BiLSTM model, with parameters for embedding size, hidden size, vocabulary size, number of layers, output size, dropout, and a forward method.
we trained the BiLSTM model on the dataset using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, and evaluated its performance using F1 micro and F1 macro.
then I added a character-level CNN for additional features and retrained the model.
I used PyTorch's built-in dataset and dataloader classes to handle the input data and collate the batches.
I performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the model.
